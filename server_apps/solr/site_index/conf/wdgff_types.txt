# A customized type mapping for WordDelimiterFilterFactory
# the allowable types are: LOWER, UPPER, ALPHA, DIGIT, ALPHANUM, SUBWORD_DELIM
#
# the default for any character without a mapping is always computed from
# Unicode character properties

# Map the $, %, '.', and ',' characters to DIGIT
# This might be useful for financial data.

# Example for indexing text like twitter's hash and at symbol usage from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9299614
# @ => ALPHA
# \u0023 => ALPHA

# Including underscore as an ALPHA character for such terms as XM_694032
_ => ALPHA
