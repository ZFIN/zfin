# Crontab format, from left to right
# * minute (0-59),
# * hour (0-23),
# * day of the month (1-31),
# * month of the year (1-12),
# * day of the week (0-6 with 0=Sunday)
#
# Each of these patterns may be either an  asterisk
# (meaning all legal values)    OR
#       a list of elements separated by commas.
# An element is either a number OR
#       two numbers separated by  a minus  sign
#       (meaning  an  inclusive  range).
# Note that the specification of days may be made by two fields
# (day of  the month and day of the week).
# Both are adhered to if specified as a list of elements.
#
# NO BLANK LINES

# --------------
# cron.chart.fig is a graphic depiction of cron at ZFIN.  Any time you
# change this file, also change cron.chart.fig.
#
#
# Each entry has comment precedeing it stating:
# 1. What "nights" it is run.  We include the following morning as part of
#    the night.  That is, both Sunday night at 10 pm and Monday morning at
#    1 am are both part of Sunday night.
# 2. What time it is run.
# 3. Description of the job.
#
# 
# Entries are ordered by start time/night.  Ordering them by when they run
# is the easiest way to tell what jobs might interfere with each other.  
# Each portion of the night is reserved for a particular type of job.
# CURATOR SUPPORT and MISC jobs can run at any time.
