# What exactly does night 0 mean?  Well: 
#  o The comments in this file indicate what night a cron job runs on, not 
#    what day.
#  o Nights start at 5pm and run through the following morning.
#  o The name of the night is the name of the day the night started on.
#
# Night "0" comes from applying this scheme to months.  Does the first
# night of the month start at 5 pm on the last day of the previous month,
# or does it start at 5 pm on the first day of the current month?
#
# I went with the latter: 
#  o Night 1 starts at 5 pm on the first day of the current month.
#  o Therefore, night 0 is the night that starts at 5pm on the last day of 
#    the previous month.
#
# Using night 0 should also help people notice that something different is
# going on here.  Hopefully, they will then actually put the time in to
# read these comments.
