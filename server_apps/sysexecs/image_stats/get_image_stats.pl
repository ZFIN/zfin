#
# Script to get stats of a file stored in an image.
#
# Calls anytopnm and pnmfile (part of the netpbm package) to get the 
# width and height of an image.  pnmfile outputs something like the following:
#
# STDOUT:
#  stdin:  PPM raw, 98 by 59  maxval 255
#
# If the expected output is not given then this script outputs "0 0".
#
# Usage:
#
#   get_image_stats.pl imageFile
#
#     imageFile  Name of file containing an image.
#
#   Returns:
#
#     0  Stats were successfully obtained from the file.  The width and
#        height values were written to STDOUT as "widthValue heightValue"
#    >0  Stats were not successfully obtained from the file.  In this
#        case "0 0" is written to STDOUT.
