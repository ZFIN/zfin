thinking about where to pull GFF files from Ensembl/Vega 
as the period is apt to be tied to the two month Ensembl
cycle this seems like a good starting point.


wget  ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/vega/danio/gff3/vega_danio_rerio_20070803.gff3

wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/current_gtf/danio_rerio/Danio_rerio.ZFISH7.49.gtf.gz

reminder that when a new assembly is released the foreign DB
name changes to reflect the new assembly.

care must be taken to look for sql that uses
 fdbcont_fdb_db_name = 'Ensembl(zV7)'

*** NOTE ***

it is also very important to do 'gmake run' first
as it can happen a new ensembl release (danio_rerio_core_xx_x)
is in ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/current_mysql/

before it is available in
 
 mysql:// ensembldb.ensembl.org:3306

should also note the mysql port changed from 3306 to 5306
when they upgraded to a newer mysql v5. 
the old port is still in place to serve the old v4 releases.

there is a script that pings Ensembl looking for updates.
when one is found an email alert goes out and
someone comes to this dir and types:

> gmake run
> gmake run_commit

which executes fetch_ensdarg.sh

	fetch_ensdarg.sh tries to determind the
	most recent Ensembl database release.
	then makes a remote mysql connection with a
	query (fetch_ensdarg.sql)that finds ENSDARGs
	with a 1:1 corespondnce with ZDBIDs (as assigned by Ensembl).
	these ENSDARG ZDBID pairs are returned  one per line
	in a pipe terminated file 'ensdarg.unl'
	which is loaded into the local database by calling
	dbaccess with the 'load_ensdarg.sql' script.

this code never made it into Production.
Although it seemed in theory, a very good idea to the curators,
In practice the automated Ensembl builds at Sanger are not yet ready
ready for prime time. maybe when the assembley gets better
Sanger (and our curators) will feel more comfortable adding these links.


there are also issues of how to commumicate to users
that this is a strictily mechanical prediction
that no human has checked.


############################################################

To find Ensembl ENSDARG links for ZFIN,
we directly query the Ensembl mysql database in Sanger.

the 'fetch_ensdarg.sh' script needs to be called
with the name of the current release, core zebrafish ensembl database.

i.e. danio_rerio_core_18_2 or danio_rerio_core_19_2

I currently have not attempted to find an automated way supplying
the correct argument because I expect the data will only change
when there is a new release several times a year. it will be faily
easy to detect new release announcements and manually run the script.
if the data changes within a release or the releases come often
we can find an automated method of choosing correct argument.

fetch_ensdarg.sh sends the query in 'fetch_ensdarg.sql' off to Sanger
and  calls 'load_ensdarg.sql' to load the results into ZFIN.
