To find Ensembl ENSDARG links for ZFIN, 
we directly query the Ensembl mysql database in Sanger.

the 'fetch_ensdarg.sh' script needs to be called 
with the name of the current release, core zebrafish ensembl database.

i.e. danio_rerio_core_18_2 or danio_rerio_core_19_2

I currently have not attempted to finf an autometed way supplying 
the correct argument because I expect the data will only change 
when there is a new release several times a year. it will be faily
easy to detect new release announcements and manually run the script.
if the data changes within a release or the releases come often
we can find an automated method of choosing correct argument.

fetch_ensdarg.sh sends the query in 'fetch_ensdarg.sql' off to Sanger
and  calls 'load_ensdarg.sql' to load the results into ZFIN.
