We determined the expression levels of maternal and zygotic transcripts and clustered them based on expression pattern. We identified a large number of novel transcribed regions in un-annotated regions of the genome, as well as splice variants with an estimated frequency of 40-75% during early zebrafish embryogenesis. Our data constitute a useful resource for developmental studies, gene discovery, and genome annotation."		"baseline,developmental time course"

Paired-end sequence data has been generated using polyA selected RNA from a range of zebrafish tissues and developmental stages using the Illumina Genome Analyzer. These data have been used to improve the gene annotation of the zebrafish genome. Study description: Zebrafish total RNA was extracted from embryonic and adult tissue, then polyA selected. After fragmentation and reverse transcription Illumina sequencing libraries were prepared. Paired-end sequence runs were performed with 36, 37, 54 and 76 base reads on the Illumina Genome Analyzer."

Recent years have seen great advancement in the understanding of the regulatory mechanisms during zebrafish embryogenesis and immune processes, yet large gaps still remain in the functional pathways critical for each developmental stage, especially for the late embryonic development. We sequenced the polyA-extracted mRNA from 9 stages covering 7 major developmental periods of zebrafish. Whole genome gene expression pattern were analyzed to reveal unknown pathways or factors with implicated roles during each stage of vertebrate development."		"baseline,developmental time course"

Understanding the neurotranscriptomic architecture will greatly facilitate and enhance interpretation of research projects. Studies have reported that there are strain and sex-specific behavioral variation particulary in response to stress and anxiety-inducing scenarios. Capitalizing on previously documented behavioral variation by strains and sex of zebrafish, this study seeks to understand the neurotranscriptomic mechanisms potentially underlying this variation. Through RNA-sequencing (4 biological replicates per strain further subdivided into 2 biological replicates per sex) we analyzed the whole-brain transcriptomic profiles of four strains of zebrafish and relate transcriptional differences to phenotypic differences (e.g. behavioral or morphological) of the strains. Using a balanced block design, all 16 samples were multiplexed and run across 16 lanes on an Illumina GAIIx. Resulting reads (approximately 52 million reads per biological replicate) were aligned to the Zv9 genome build. We subsequently performed differential gene expression analysis and weighted gene coexpression network analysis to identify genes and gene networks associated with a phenotype. The goal of the study is to identify neurotranscriptomic mechanisms underlying phenotypic (e.g. morphological, behavioral) variation in zebrafish."		"baseline, tissue type study, sex"
