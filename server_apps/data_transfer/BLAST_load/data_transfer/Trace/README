Progression of files:
--------------------------------------------------
All files downloaded to: 
@BLASTSERVER_FASTA_FILE_PATH@/fasta/Trace/

Blastdbs and log files generated in:
/tmp  and (depending on mode)
@BLASTSERVER_FASTA_FILE_PATH@/fasta/Trace

Blastdbs moved to:
@BLASTSERVER_BLAST_DATABASE_PATH@/Current

--------------------------------------------------
Usage:
--------------------------------------------------
./processTrace.sh : runs throu all targets in the proper order.  Downloads
files, processes them, converts them to blast db files and pushes the 
blast files to the production area of blast files.

./revertTrace.sh : pulls the Backup version of the fasta file that was 
archived last time and the blastdb files that were archived last time
and puts them in the production area.  Revert only works after a complete 
load.  Reverting after a simple ./downloadTrace.sh will result in an
unworkable system because ./dowloadTrace.sh removes its trace.ftp file
in favor of a more up to date one.

./downloadTrace.sh : downloads the file from the Trace site in two modes: 0 
for a complete re-do of the blastdb, 1 for the incremental update mode.
blastdbupdate.pl (one dir up from this) controls this for the production
system.  To run this independently, you must provide a 0 or 1 as input to 
the ./downloadTrace.sh call.  Be carefule which you use.  If it is an
update, then the script uses nrdb to weed out all dups in the current
blastdb and then gets the new update.

./convertTrace.sh : uses @BLASTSERVER_FASTA_FILE_PATH@/fasta/Trace/trace_zf.sh to build
blastdb files.

./pushTrace.sh : pushes blastdb files from building dir to 
$BLASTSERVER_BLAST_DATABASE_PATH/Current/

------------------------------------------------------------
Download info: 
------------------------------------------------------------

	 time: approximately 20 minutes.
	 content: one file whose name changes on each release.
	 	  This script finds the most recent version and then
		  increments a counter inside itself to find the next version.
		  Version information as well as path information is stored
		  in the trace.ftp file in this directory.
		  
------------------------------------------------------------
Remaining Higgly-Piggly-ness:
------------------------------------------------------------
The Trace site will update fasta files for download in place (without
changing the file version or name). So, this set of scripts has a "mode."  
Mode must be set by developer (0 or 1 depending on action required).  
Sometimes in development, if you pick the wrong mode, it won't build a 
fasta file called trace_zf.fa, then convert won't work.  Pick the right mode.

The downloadTrace.sh script replaces its trace.ftp file, and secondaly
it has a trace.ftp file in the first place, and this file can not be checked
into SVN...AND, if it is gone, we don't have any idea of how to recreate
without going to the doc and finding the trace site and finding the most
recent file.  Here is the last ftp file content, in case: 

data_transfer/Trace% less trace.ftp 
ftp.ncbi.nih.gov|pub/TraceDB/danio_rerio|fasta.danio_rerio.090.gz|
