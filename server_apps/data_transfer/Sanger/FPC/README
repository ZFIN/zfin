FROM Sanger:

#1) Marker file

   filename  : markers.<date>.txt
          e.g. markers.12.05.03.txt

   format : <sanger_sts_id>|<sanger_sts_aliases>|<other_sts_aliases>|primer1|primer2

   There may be more than 1 entry in the sanger_sts_aliases field and/or the 
   other_sts_aliases field, in these cases multiple entries are seperated by ";"

2) Clone marker file

    filename : clonemarker.<date>.txt 
          e.g. clonemarker.12.05.03.txt

    format  :  <sanger_cloneID>|<sanger_sts_name>|<relationship type>

    where relationship type is 1 : sts is designed from the end seq of this clone
                               2 : sts is found by e-PCR in the genomic seq of this 
                                   clone
                     empty field : sts is found in WGS contig by e-PCR which has been 
                                   aligned to this region (approx. +/- 150kb). There 
                                   is no direct relationship with the clone and this 
                                   data is covered by all the same caveats as the WGS 
                                   contigs.

3) Contig names file

   filename : ctgnames.<date>.txt  
         e.g. ctgnames.12.05.03.txt

   format   : <contigID>|<sanger_cloneID>|<international_cloneID

should the FPC_contigs also be linked to the markers?

where db_name = 'Sanger_FPC'
