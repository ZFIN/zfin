Run on request by hand in any instance (for testing) 
but _from_ <production> as yourself. (hence production)

gmake run

does:

./generate_UniProt_Nomenclature_run.sh
	
will fetch accessions for longest protein associated
with genes without orthologs or informative nomenclature
from the database in your current enviroment

fetch sequences for those accessions from the blast databases

blast the fasta file against Human, Mouse and zebrafish Uniprot

parse the blast output into more convineiant objects and
write the result out as a  UniProt_{timestamp}.ctx file

which may be (manualy) coppied into the ReNo directory 
on any instance as 

	'run.ctx' 

where you would issue a 'gmake run' command 
to populate ReNo with this run in which ever instance 
the .ctx file was coppied to.

recomend loading into at least one test db before production

there are listing and deleting sql scripts in common/bin 
to help maintain the set of runs, since there can be alot of hits 
to copy around uselessly after the run is finished it is good to  
activly push the curators about deleting old runs.
