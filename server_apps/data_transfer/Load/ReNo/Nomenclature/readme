typicaly run on production the beginning of the month by hand
in any instance (for testing) but from helix

generate_UniProt_Nomenclature_run.sh
	
will fetch accessions for longest protein associated
with genes without orthologs or informative nomenclature
from the database in your current enviroment

fetch sequences for those accessions from the blast databases

blast the fasta file against Human Mouse and zebrafish Uniprot

parse the blast output into more convineiant objects and
write the result out as a  UniProt_{timestamp}.ctx file

which may be (manualy) coppied into *any* ReNo directory as 

'run.ctx' where you would issue a 'gmake run' command 
to populate ReNo with this run in which ever instance 
the .ctx file was coppied to.

recomend loading into at least one test db before production
till we are more comfortable with this process
