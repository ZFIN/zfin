  ZFIN Objective:
------------------------------------------------------------------

To extract relationships from GenPept files that can be used to 
create Protien sequence links for Zebrafish genes.
  
------------------------------------------------------------------
  Data Files:
------------------------------------------------------------------  

Genbank hosts individual GenPept records on their Entrez Web site. 

ZFIN is interested in:
all zebrafish protien acessions and the acessions of neculotide
sequences from which the protiens were derived.

------------------------------------------------------------------
  Procedure:
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
DOWNLOADING
Using fetch-genpept.r , the most recent GenPept records are 
dowloaded from NCBI's Entrez page.

The ~20Meg http stream is parsed into a ~200k Informix load file.

the load file is inserted into the database with the 
load_genpept.sql script  via dbaccess

CLEAN & REPLACE
To insert the data, we use a wipe and replace approach. All GenPept,
that are soley attributed to the automated curation pub are removed. 
(as well as any attributed to a EMBL load)
All relationships from the latest download are found. 
Then the relationships that do not exist in ZFIN are inserted into 
the database and they are attributed to the automtated curation pub.

This process is automated to perform weekly in crontab.
