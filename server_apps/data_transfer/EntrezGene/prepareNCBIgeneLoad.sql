-- prepareNCBIgeneLoad.sql
--
-- This SQL script prepares the following 2 unload files to be used by the code in the Perl script to do the mapping and the final loading script.
--
-- 1) toMap.unl      
-- this is a list of gene zdb ids that are supported by non-loaded GenBank RNA accessions and genes on this list will be processed to map to NCBI gene records
--
-- 2) toDelete.unl      
-- this is a list of db_link zdb ids that are to be deleted before doing the loading with a new list of db_link zdb ids
