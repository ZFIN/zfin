Progression of files:
--------------------------------------------------
All files downloaded to: 
@BLASTSERVER_FASTA_FILE_PATH@/fasta/GB/
(script itself creates and manages this directory).

Blastdbs and log files generated in:
/tmp  and (depending on mode)
@BLASTSERVER_FASTA_FILE_PATH@/fasta/GenBank

Blastdbs moved to:
$BLASTSERVER_BLAST_DATABASE_PATH/Current

--------------------------------------------------
Usage (from your checkout directory):
--------------------------------------------------

./processGenBank.sh : runs throu all targets in the proper order.  Downloads
files, processes them, converts them to blast db files and pushes the 
blast files to the production area of blast files.

./revertGenBank.sh : more complicated than the other revert scripts.  Because
there are so many files and dbs are so large, we have to move the symlink 
from /Current to /Backup, and then cp the files around.  Best not to
revert too often, or move the files manually, if you only need a small set.

./downloadGenBank.sh : downloads many, many, many files (almost 75G of files
just for the EST division of GenBank), from almost all divisions of 
GenBank.  Just downloading the EST files takes 14 hours.  
Unzipping just 1/3 of these files takes 3 hours, parsing just 1/3
of these files takes 4 hours, doing the rest of the processing takes a long, 
long time too.  

./convertGenBank.sh : takes each file and runs it through gb2fa.pl
parsing just 1/3 of these files takes 4 hours, doing the rest of the 
processing takes a long, long time too.
  
./pushGenBank.sh : pushes blastdb files from building dir to 
$BLASTSERVER_BLAST_DATABASE_PATH/Current/ by moving symlinks around.
