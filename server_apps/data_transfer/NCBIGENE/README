
Overview of the NCBI Gene Load
-------------------------------

This process loads the following db_link records based on mapped gene records between ZFIn and NCBI:
1) NCBI Gene Ids
2) UniGene Ids
3) RefSeq accessioons (including RefSeq RNA, RefPept, RefSeq DNA)
4) GenBank accessions (including GenBank RNA, GenPept, GenBank DNA)

NCBI_gene_load.pl is the control script. It executes the prepareNCBIgeneLoad.sql to generate the delete list and a set of ZFIN genes with RNA.
Then, the script maps ZFIN gene records to NCBI gene records based on
1) common GenBank RNA accessions
2) common Vega Gene Id
Then, the script execute the loadNCBIgeneAccs.sql to delete all the db_link records previously loaded 
(accrding to the delete list), and load all the accessions for the gene records mapped.

The values of dblink_length are also processed and loaded. And statistics and various reports are generated and emailed.

Step 1: Download and decompress NCBI data files
-------------------------------------------------

ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DATA/GENE_INFO/Non-mammalian_vertebrates/Danio_rerio.gene_info.gz

                (6.3M decompressed, 33K+ rows)

ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/release-catalog/RefSeq-release59.catalog.gz

                            (3.8G decompressed, 39M+ rows)

7955    Danio rerio     NM_001001398.2  89191827        complete|vertebrate_other       PROVISIONAL     1613

Step 2: Prepare the delete list (of db_link records) and the list of ZFIN genes for mapping
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prepare a delete list of ZDB Ids for all the above accessions that are attributed to NCBI/EntrezGene load publications (ZDB-PUB-020723-3 and ZDB-PUB-130725-2)

Retain those db_link records that are also in expression_experiment2 table

Retain those db_link accessions which are not related to gene or pseudogene

Retain those attributed to a publication other than NCBI/EntrezGene load publication.

Run SQL to get all the gene ZDB Ids with GenBank RNA accessions in ZFIN that are associated directly to a ZFIN gene record or to a ZFIN gene record through an encodes relationship.

select dblink_linked_recid as gene
  from db_link
 where dblink_fdbcont_zdb_id = "ZDB-FDBCONT-040412-37"     -- GenBank RNA
   and (dblink_linked_recid like "ZDB-GENE%" or dblink_linked_recid like "ZDB-LINCRNAG%" or dblink_linked_recid like "ZDB-MIRNAG%")
union
select mrel_mrkr_1_zdb_id as gene
  from marker_relationship
 where mrel_type = "gene encodes small segment"
   and exists(select "x" from db_link
               where dblink_linked_recid = mrel_mrkr_2_zdb_id
                 and dblink_fdbcont_zdb_id = "ZDB-FDBCONT-040412-37");  -- GenBank RNA

Store the 20K+ genes (including a handful of pseudogene) in hash to be used for mapping based upon RNA evidence.

Step 3: Gather statistics for all the following NCBI accessions at ZFIN
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run SQLs to get the numbers of all the following accessions got from NCBI/EntrezGene load before the next step of deletion.

NCBI Gene Ids                         ZDB-FDBCONT-040412-1                 not curatable        no length

UniGene Ids                           ZDB-FDBCONT-040412-44                not curatable        no length           

RefSeq RNA accessions                 ZDB-FDBCONT-040412-38                not curatable       

RefSeq polypeptide accessions         ZDB-FDBCONT-040412-39                not curatable    

RefSeq DNA accessions                 ZDB-FDBCONT-040527-1                 not curatable    

GenBank RNA accessions                ZDB-FDBCONT-040412-37                curatatble         

GenPept accessions                    ZDB-FDBCONT-040412-42                curatatble    

GenBank DNA accessions                ZDB-FDBCONT-040412-36                curatatble     

And get number of ZFIN genes that are with all kinds of ResSeq accessions.

Step 4: Parse NCBI's gene_info file
-------------------------------------

Parse the following file to get the NCBI records with gene Id, symbol, and Vega Id

Danio_rerio.gene_info.gz     (6.3M decompressed, 33,834 rows)

#Format: tax_id GeneID Symbol LocusTag Synonyms dbXrefs chromosome map_location description type_of_gene Symbol_from_nomenclature_authority Full_name_from_nomenclature_authority Nomenclature_status Other_designations Modification_date

7955    30037   tnc     CH211-166O17.1  tenc|wu:fk04d02 ZFIN:ZDB-GENE-980526-104|Ensembl:ENSDARG00000021948|Vega:OTTDARG00000032698     5       -       tenascin C      protein-coding  tnc     tenascin C      O       etID309720.5|tenascin   20130529

gene2accession.gz           (2.37G unzipped, 28,964,915 rows)

Get NCBI-gene-Id/Symbols and store them in a hash.

Get NCBI-gene-Id/Vega-gene-Id and store them in a hash.

Step 5: Map ZFIN gene records to NCBI gene records
--------------------------------------------------

Step 5-1: initial set of ZFIN records
---------------------------------------

The very initial set of ZFIN records is generated by Step 3.

Run SQL to get all the ZDB Gene Ids with symbols and store them in another hash.

Loop thru the 20,702 ZFIN genes with supporting GenBank RNA evidence to create the following data structure:

%supportedGeneZFIN: A hash with ZDB Gene Id as keys and references to arrays of supporting GenBank accessions as values.

Example:  ZDB-GENE-091218-2 =>  [CU468750, CU468771, EB980341, JN653075]

Have another hash, %accZFINsupportingOnly1, to store all the supporting GenBank RNA accessions at ZFIN.

Example:  CU468750  => ZDB-GENE-091218-2

Find out GenBank accessions that support more than 1 ZFIN genes and put them in a similar data structure 

Example:  BC153646 => [ZDB-GENE-030707-2, ZDB-GENE-070627-1]

Find out the ZFIN genes with at least 1 of its supporting RNA accessions that support other ZFIN gene(s), and store them in a similar data structure 

Example:  ZDB-GENE-070627-1 => [BC115161, BC153646]

These 36 ZFIN gene records will be excluded from the mapping.

Step 5-2: Get length values:
-----------------------------

This section continues to deal with dblink_length field
 There are 3 sources for length:
 1) the existing dblink_length for GenBank including GenPept records
 2) the length value of RefSeq sequences on NCBI's RefSeq-release#.catalog file
 3) calculated length (done after Step 5-3) for those not got from the above 2

Step 5-3: initial set of NCBI records
---------------------------------------

Parse the following NCBI's gene2accession data files:

#Format: tax_id GeneID status RNA_nucleotide_accession.version RNA_nucleotide_gi protein_accession.version protein_gi genomic_nucleotide_accession.version genomic_nucleotide_gi start_position_on_the_genomic_accession end_position_on_the_genomic_accession orientation assembly mature_peptide_accession.version mature_peptide_gi Symbol

7955    30560   PROVISIONAL     NM_001001398.2   89191827    NP_001001398.2  89191828     NW_003336223.1  312122430       3478905 3485447 +       Reference Zv9 Primary Assembly  -       -       fgf6a

7955    30037   -       BC163556.1      190339183       AAI63556.1      190339184       -       -       -       -       ?       -       -       -       tnc

Store the parsed information (GenBank accessions and RefSeq accessions) in various data structures to be used for mapping and loading.

NCBI gene Ids and their supporting GenBank RNA accessions are stored in similar data structures as those in Step 4-1.

Example of %supportedGeneNCBI:            100000223  => [ BC097203, BC171342, BC171346]

Example of %accNCBIsupportingOnly1                BC097203  => 100000223                   

There is only one GenBank RNAs supporting more than 1 NCBI genes:   U10869  => [30122, 553976]

Correspondingly, there are only 2 NCBI genes are with GenBank RNA(s) one of which supports other NCBI gene:

30122 =>   [BC044143, BC055535, BC164176, U10869]
553976  => [U10869]

These 2 will be excluded from mapping.

Step 5-4: get 1:1, 1:N and 1:0 from ZFIN to NCBI
-------------------------------------------------

Loop thru hash %supportedGeneZFIN to look up if the supporting RNAs are in hash %accNCBIsupportingOnly1.

If there is, link the value of hash %accNCBIsupportingOnly1 (NCBI gene) to ZFIN gene. If not, it's belonging to 1:0 ZFIN set.

It could be 2 cases:

1:1 - 1 ZFIN gene with all its supporting RNAs that are supporting only 1 NCBI gene

        The final 1:1 set is a subset of this one-way 1:1 set.

1:N (1 ZFIN gene with its supporting RNAs that are supporting more than 1 NCBI gene)

       The final 1:N (ZFIN to NCBI) set is a subset of this one-way 1:N set.

Step 5-5: get 1:1, 1:N and 1:0 from NCBI to ZFIN
-------------------------------------------------

Loop thru hash %supportedGeneNCBI to look up if the supporting RNAs are in hash %accZFINsupportingOnly1.

If there is, link the value of hash %accNCBIsupportingOnly1 (ZFIN gene) to NCBI gene. If not, it's belonging to 1:0 NCBI set.

It could be 2 cases:

1:1 (1 NCBI gene with all its supporting RNAs that are supporting only 1 ZFIN gene)

     The final 1:1 set is a subset of this one-way 1:1 set.

1:N (1 NCBI gene with its supporting RNAs that are supporting more than 1 ZFIN gene)

     The final 1:N (NCBI to ZFIN) or N:1 (ZFIN to NCBI) set is a subset of this one-way 1:N set.

Step 5-6: compare the 2-way mapping results and get the final 1:1, 1:N, N:1, and N:N sets
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Loop thru the 1:1 (ZFIN to NCBI) set got from Step 4-3

    If found 1:N the other way (NCBI to ZFIN), that's not a final 1:1.

Loop thru the 1:1 (NCBI to ZFIN) set got from Step 4-4

    If found 1:N the other way (ZFIN to NCBI), that's not a final 1:1.

Both of the above get the same final 1:1 set.   [18,768]

Loop thru the 1:N (ZFIN to NCBI) set got from Step 4-3

    If found 1:N the other way (NCBI to ZFIN), that's not a final 1:N (ZFIN to NCBI), and that's N:N.

Loop thru the 1:N (NCBI to ZFIN) set got from Step 4-4

    If found 1:N the other way (ZFIN to NCBI), that's not a final 1:N (NCBI to ZFIN), and that's N:N.

Final 1:N (ZFIN to NCBI) - 99

Final N:1 (ZFIN to NCBI) - 75

N:N - 29 groups from ZFIN to NCBI; 33 groups from NCBI to ZFIN

Print all the records to be loaded to the add list.

Step 6: map ZFIN gene records to NCBI gene Ids based on common Vega Gene Id

For those ZFIN genes not in final 1:1, 1:N, N:1, N:N and those excluded for RNA-based mapping sets.

Step 7: prepare the add list for db_link records of RefSeq accessions, GenBank accessions and UniGene Ids
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run SQL to get the existing db_link data to be kept (including manually curated db_link accessions) and store in a hash to avoid re-loading them

Output the accessions and related info such as length values to be loaded (according to mapping) to the add list, toLoad.unl; Output the accessions, current attribution, 1 of the 2 load pubs (according to mapping type) to toAttribute.unl.

Parse NCBI's gene2unigene file and output those mapped ones to the add list, toLoad.unl file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 8: Execute loadNCBIgeneAccs.sql to:

1) do the deletion based on the delete list, toDelete.unl file

2) do the inserting based on the add list, toLoad.unl file

3) also, add load attribution for manually curated GenBank accessions, according to the toAttribute.unl file

4) check the number of accessions missing dblink_length value before and after
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 9: Gather statistics and do reporting
----------------------------------------------

Report GenPept accessions associated with ZFIN genes still attributed to a non-load pub
 
Run same SQLs as those at Step 3.

Calculate percentage change and write to the report file.

Email all reports.
