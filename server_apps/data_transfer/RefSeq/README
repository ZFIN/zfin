NCBI hosts an FTP server with LocusLink and RefSeq data files.  The
files are unloads from their database, updated as often as the like.
Information pertaining to the structure of the files can be obtained
from the README file on their FTP server.

ZFIN's objective is to extract relationships from the files that can
be used to create orthologue and sequence links for Zebrafish genes.

The process starts by downloading the most recent files from 
  ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/LocusLink/.
Each file is uncompressed using gunzip then each file is parsed
with a perl script; relevant fields are written to an Informix
load file. When the load files are made it is time to submit the 
data. 

To insert the data, we use a wipe and replace approach. All RefSeq,
LocusLink, and UniGENE links that are only attributed to the 
automated curation pub are removed. All relationships from the
latest download are found. Then the relationships that do not 
exist in ZFIN are inserted into the database and they are 
attributed to the automtated curation pub.

This process automated to perform weekly.
