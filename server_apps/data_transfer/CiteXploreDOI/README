NOTES:

To generate another wsdl-client.jar file (e.g. if CiteXplore ever changes its interface):

./generateStubs.sh 

The files in bin rely on the jar files in lib, otherweise I would have moved them into Common/lib/Java.  

The scripts and jars were taken directly from the jaxws-ri site.  Exceptions to this are:
lib/wsdl-client.jar
build.xml  # called by gmake
Makefile  # called by gmake
MANIFEST.MF # used to build jar
citeexploredoi.jar # generated jar file
source/*.java # the code that does the work
updatedois.sh # used to run citexploredoi.jar in daily scripts
