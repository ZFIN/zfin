On PostGreSQL (not Informix), run the following

generateSQLsForMergingRecords.pl ZDB_ID1 ZDB_ID2

to generate the SQLs (written to merge.sql) needed for the merge action.

If the records are zdb_active_data records, need to first change the "rollback work" into "commit work;"
in the merge.sql and execute the file on PostGreSQL. Then, run another Perl script on PostGreSQL.

generatePostMergeSQLs.pl ZDB_ID1 ZDB_ID2

to generate the rest of SQLs (written to post-merge.sql).

Copy the SQLs from post-merge.sql and add them into merge.sql. 

Then, merge.sql could be executed on bith Innformix and PostGreSQL to get the two ZFIN records merged.

Notice that if the records are two markers, the merge.sql could be only executed on bith Innformix, 
since there is some SQL syntax with select ... into temp table, which could not be executed on PostGreSQL.

The key code to generate the SQLs is inside the recursive function, which takes advantage of PostGreSQL Information Schema views.
