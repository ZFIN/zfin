On PostGreSQL, run the following

generateSQLsForMergingRecords.pl ZDB_ID1 ZDB_ID2

to generate the SQLs (written to merge.sql) needed for the merge action.

Execute the merge.sql file on PostGreSQL. Then, run another Perl script on PostGreSQL.

generatePostMergeSQLs.pl ZDB_ID1 ZDB_ID2

to generate the rest of SQLs (written to post-merge.sql).

Execute the post-merge.sql file to make sure there is no error.

If no error, final-merge.sql has all the SQLs needed to get the two ZFIN records merged and could be copied to the LiquiBase file (ZDB_ID1 merged into ZDB_ID2).

Notice that no previous name/alias is created by the generated SQLs. If previous name/alias is needed, some SQL for that purpose should be manually added to final-merge.sql.

The key code to generate the SQLs is inside the recursive function, which takes advantage of PostGreSQL Information Schema views.

As long as all necessary foreign keys are in place, all data associated with ZDB_ID1 should be able to be moved to ZDB_ID2 after executing the SQLs in final-merge.sql

(or after executing merge.sql and post-merge.sql).
