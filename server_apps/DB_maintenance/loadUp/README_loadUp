SUMMARY:

These directories were created in December of 2004 to hold images (imageLoadUp)
and PDFs (PDFLoadUp) that had been stored in the database as blobs.

Currently, these directories are owned by zfishweb (the user that .cgi
scripts run as) and belong to the apache www group.

***IMPORTANT***
When moving zfin.org to development machine:
After creating a good copy of the filesystems under the development machine-specific
loadUp/ tree, you *must* change the file
permissions on the rsync'd directory to be owned zfishweb:www. You must also alter the apache config
files to allow open access to the development machine-specific images on development
***IMPORTANT***

The /bkup/ directories in each of the PDF and image directories hold
copies of images that have been replaced by users.


APACHE CONFIGURATION:

Apache is configured to recognize /imageLoadUp as an alias of
/research/zcentral(or zprod if on production server)/loadUp/imageLoadup
and /PDFLoadUp as an alias of 
/research/zcentral(or zprod if on production server)/loadUp/PDFLoadup
on development.  The production apache configuration is slightly different

Apache on production is configured to recognize /imageLoadUp as an alias of
/research/zprod/loadUp/imageLoadup
and /PDFLoadUp as an alias of 
/research/zprod/loadUp/PDFLoadup

Apache on development is also configured to recognize /development machineImageLoadUp 
as an alias of /research/zcentral/loadUp/development machineLoadUp/development machineImageLoadUp
and /development machinePDFLoadUp as an alias of 
/research/zcentral/loadUp/development machineLoadup/development machinePDFLoadUp

see /private/httpd/conf on emrbyonix or helix for more details.

TRANSLATE TABLE INFO:

In addition, all translate table files (except helix.tt and development machine.tt)
define the following generic tags to access these directories:

<!--|IMAGE_LOAD|-->		/imageLoadUp
<!--|LOADUP_FULL_PATH|-->	/research/zcentral/loadUp
<!--|PDF_LOAD|-->		/PDFLoadUp

for the development machine.tt (with zfin.org on development machine)

<!--|IMAGE_LOAD|-->		/development machineImageLoadUp/imageLoadUp
<!--|LOADUP_FULL_PATH|-->	/private/ZfinLinks/loadUp/development machineLoadUp
<!--|PDF_LOAD|-->		/development machinePDFLoadUp/PDFLoadUp

for the helix.tt, these tags are:

<!--|IMAGE_LOAD|-->		/imageLoadUp
<!--|LOADUP_FULL_PATH|-->	/private/ZfinLinks/loadUp
<!--|PDF_LOAD|-->		/PDFLoadUp

***IMPORTANT***
Note, for helix.tt and development machine.tt, the full path is actually redirected
through ZfinLinks.  This is to help us when we move zfin.org to
development machine.  See documentation in ZfinLinks for more information.
The symlinks for these directories in ZfinLinks will *have* to be updated
when moving zfin.org to development machine!
***IMPORTANT***


The apache configuration, along with these generic tags, means that in 
apg pages, to access a file in /research/zcentral/loadUp/imageLoadUp
one only needs to code <!--|IMAGE_LOAD|-->/$filename; where $filename is like 
'ZDB-IMAGE-040101-1'.  

Note, the '/' required after the image tag and before 
the filename. 

While the above apache configuration makes it easy to find the files
via an apg page, scripts that do not run through the apache server need
a full path to know where to store an uploaded file).
<!--|LOADUP_FULL_PATH|--> is used for this purpose.

In these kinds of scripts it is not uncommon to see
<!--|LOADUP_FULL_PATH|--><!--|IMAGE_LOAD|-->/$filename as a filepath. 

It is important to note that all development databases and .tt files point to 
the same directory on development machine.  This means that any images loaded from hoover
can also be seen on albino.  It also means that files can be overwritten
if they have the same filename as is already present in the shared 
directory.

This does not mean that records will be created
in the database clemdb if they are created in the database hoovdb, however.  
Filesystem additions are GLOBAL to developers, database records are LOCAL 
to developers.  

When zfin.org is on development machine, the apache configuration changes slightly, and
the development machine.tt file always points to slightly different directories.
This is to prevent changes on the development machine to affect the
production repository of pdfs/images.  

See /private/http/conf/http.conf.development machine, and development machine.tt for details.

FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS:

Image files in the filesystem are named with their image zdb id,
and image suffix like:
ZDB-IMAGE-010101-1.jpg

Image thumbnails are named with their image zdb id and an '_thumb' and 
their image suffix like:
ZDB-IMAGE-010101-1_thumb.jpg

Images with annotations (mostly Thisse images) are named with their
image zdb id and an '_annot' and their image suffix like:
ZDB-IMAGE-010101-1_annot.jpg

PDF files are named with their publication zdb id and a pdf suffix like:
ZDB-PUB-010101-1.pdf

Files are named this way for easy comparison with database records, and
so that files can be automatically moved in an orderly manner (ie: all
image files associated with ZDB-IMAGE-010101-1 can be moved together
using their zdb_id prefix).

VIEWING IMAGES/PDFS SANS DATABLADE:

To view images (without using a webdatablade apg), follow the example
below, substituting hoover with your website name and the zdb_id with the
image_zdb_id that you're looking for:

http://hoover.zfin.org/imageLoadUp/ZDB-IMAGE-040401-1.jpg

NIGHTLY RSYNC:

Every night, via a cron job, the production image/pdf filesystem is 
compared to the development filesystem.  If there are differences, the 
production filesystem is automatically echoed in development.  This job is
run by a crontab file owned by zfishweb.  The script "remove_orphan_files.pl"
controls the syncing.  

remove_orphan_files.pl checks filesystem files against records
in the database and emails annomolies (see remove_orphan_files.pl for 
more details) to the owner of the database--on production that is informix.  
remove_orphan_files also calls "rsync.pl" which does the
actual syncing of production and development filesystems.

***IMPORTANT***
Syncing the development and production filesystems means deleting or copying 
files from the production filesystemto the development filesystem. 
See the rsync man pages for more details.
***IMPORTANT***

It is possible to make your own, personal filesystem for testing pdf,
image loading.  Please speak to Dave C. or Sierra for help with this.

To make a copy of the production file system on development machine (for use when
zfin.org moves to development machine), run 'makeEmbryFiles.pl.'  This script will sync 
the production filesystem in the development machine directories.  After running
there will be two copies of the entire image/pdf filesystem on development machine.
One copy will  be used by all developers (/research/zcentral/loadup/imageLoadUp
and /research/zcentral/loadUp/PDFLoadUp).  The other copy will be used
only by zfin.org on development machine:
/research/zcentral/loadUp/development machineLoadUp/development machineImageLoadUp/imageLoadUp
and
/research/zcentral/loadUp/development machineLoadUp/development machinePDFLoadUp/PDFLoadUp

***IMPORTANT***
After running makeEmbryFiles.pl, a user with the ability to sudo must
change the permissions on all the files to be owned by
zfishweb:www

Additionally, the conf file has to change to allow world-access (instead
of just access from UO and development machines) for the image files.

PDF files should never have world readable access.
