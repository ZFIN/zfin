# This file contains urls to start crawling from. Note that because the crawler does
# not discover and submit forms within pages, you must include any pages only reachable
# through forms here. Our forms generally return all records when no query parameters are 
# specified so we can successfully hit our forms without providing specific queries.
#

# WINSIZE should be tuned for indexing performance.
