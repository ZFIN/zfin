# We do not want to crawl select pages.
# These (especially xpatselect) take a long time to crawl.
# To avoid this problem, we have created a fixed-list of all the
# app pages (data) to be indexed.

select2.apg
action/anatomy
quicksearch
download-sequence

# The following are all the app pages included by the fixed-list 
# described above.  We do not want to crawl them.  Instead
# they are forcible added to the "to be indexed" list upfront.
