# This file contains keywords indicating which urls to avoid indexing. Note that these
# pages will still be crawled and urls contained in them will be indexed. This section is 
# useful for search results pages where we don't want to index the list of results but
# we do want to index the individual items.
# When the spider encounters a URL, it looks through this list of keys, if any of them
# appear in anywhere in the URL then the page won't be indexed.
#


# These are the search pages.  We no longer want to crawl them because
# they take too long to load (especially xpatselect).  Instead
# we exclude them from crawling and index all the app pages directly
# using a fixed-list of all app (data) pages generated nightly from
# a database query.
