/images/Fig-1.jpg	<b><u>Fig. 1.</u></b> Expression of hdac1is widespread in the embryo at all stages of development and most abundant in the anterior CNS. Whole-mount in situhybridisation of an hdac1cDNA probe to zebrafish embryos at the (A) two-cell, (B) 1000-cell, (C) 80% epiboly, (D) 6-somite, (E) 18-somite and (F) 24 hpf stages. (G,J) Dorsal views of the hindbrain at 24 (G) and 48 (J) hpf. (H,K) Transverse sections through the hindbrain at the level of r3/r4, at 24 (H) and 48 (K) hpf. (I,L) Transverse sections through the anterior spinal cord at 24 (I) and 48 (L) hpf. Strongest expression of hdac1is observed in the brain and spinal cord; by contrast, notochord and somites express much lower levels of hdac1transcripts
/images/Fig-2.jpg	<b><u>Fig. 2.</u></b> Mutation of hdac1 causes multiple developmental defects in the zebrafish embryo. (A,B)Bright-field images of live, 4-day-old hdac1hi1618 (A) sibling and (B) mutant embryos. Reduced brain size, absent jaw, curled down tail and pericardial oedema are clearly visible in the mutant. (C,D) Longitudinal sections of 3-day-old hdac1hi1618(C) sibling and (D) mutant embryos taken at equivalent dorsoventral levels. Anterior is towards the left. Note the reduced size of the midbrain and anterior hindbrain and the dorsally open spinal cord in the mutant embryo. Position of midbrainhindbrain boundary is marked with a black arrow. The hindbrain is indicated with a blue arrow and the row of somites (staining bright red) on the left side of each embryo is bracketed. Otic vesicles (lying below the plane of section in the sibling embryo) are marked with red arrowheads in D. (E,F)Transverse sections of 3-dayold hdac1hi1618(E) sibling and (F) mutant embryos taken at equivalent anteroposterior levels passing through the otic vesicles and the heart. Note the absence of a heart valve (arrowhead) and semi-circular canal projections (arrow), and abnormal hindbrain shape in the mutant. (G,H)Transverse sections of 3-day-old hdac1hi1618(G) sibling and (H) mutant embryos taken at equivalent anteroposterior levels passing through the pectoral fins. Note the absence of pectoral fin bud outgrowth (arrowhead) in the mutant
/images/Fig-3.jpg	<b><u>Fig. 3.</u></b> Analysis of cell proliferation in the hindbrain of hdac1hi1618 (A,C,E) sibling and (B,D,F) mutant embryos between 25 and 38 hpf. Dorsal views of hindbrains from embryos at (A,B) 25, (C,D) 33 and (E,F) 38 hpf immunostained for the mitosis marker phospho-H3. Anterior is towards the left in all panels. At 25 hpf there are substantially fewer mitotic cells in the hindbrain of hdac1hi1618 mutants than in the hindbrain of sibling embryos. By 33 hpf, the numbers of mitotic cells in the hindbrain of mutant and sibling embryos are similar and they remain so at 38 hpf. For quantitation of hindbrain mitotic indices, see Table 1. 
/images/Fig-4.gif	<a href="fxViewAll.cgi"><b>Fig. 4.</b></a>Mutation of hdac1 does not perturb primary neural patterning but neurogenesis is severely impaired. In situ hybridisation for expression of CNS patterning markers and proneural genes in hdac1 hi1618 (A,C,E,G) sibling and (B,D,F,H) mutant embryos. (A,B) pax2a at 24 hpf marks the optic chiasm, midbrain-hindbrain boundary, otic vesicle and scattered spinal interneurones; (C,D) epha4 at 32 hpf marks the forebrain and hindbrain rhombomeres 1, 3 and 5; (E,F) ash1b and (G,H) ngn1 at 25 hpf mark neuronal precursors in brain and spinal cord. Expression of pax2a and epha4 in the embryonic CNS is unperturbed by the hdac1 hi1618 mutation, whereas expression of the proneural genes ash1b and ngn1 is substantially reduced in hdac1 hi1618 mutant embryos
/images/Fig-5.jpg	<b><u>Fig. 5.</u></b>In situ hybridisation analysis comparing the expression domains of her6, ash1band ngn1in the hindbrain of hdac1hi1618sibling and mutant embryos. her6 is aberrantly expressed in the medial hindbrain of hdac1hi1618mutants at 26 and 33 hpf, and most strongly in rhombomeres 5 and 6 (arrows). By contrast, expression of ash1band ngn1in the hdac1hi1618mutant hindbrain is almost completely extinguished. (A-F) her6; (G-L) ash1b; (M-R) ngn1 expression patterns. (A,B,G,H,M,N)Dorsal views of hindbrain, 26 hpf; anterior is towards the left. (C,D,I,J,O,P) Dorsal views of hindbrain, 33 hpf; anterior is towards the left. (E,F,K,L,Q,R) Transverse sections through rhombomere 5 of hindbrain, 33 hpf; dorsal is uppermost
/images/Fig-6.jpg	<b><u>Fig. 6.</u></b> In situ hybridisation analysis comparing the expression domains of her6, ash1band ngn1in the dorsal diencephalon of hdac1hi1618 sibling and mutant embryos at 26 and 33 hpf. Loss of hdac1function causes a stable expansion of the her6 expression domain in the dorsal diencephalon (arrows), as well as reductions in the diencephalic expression domains of ash1band ngn1. (A-D) her6; (E-H) ash1b; (I-L) ngn1 expression patterns. In all panels, views are dorsal and anterior is towards the left
/images/Fig-7.jpg	<b><u>Fig. 7.</u></b> Defective production and patterning of post-mitotic neurones and glia in the hindbrain of hdac1hi1618mutant embryos. Immunohistochemistry for Hu-expressing post-mitotic neurones (A-F) and GFAP-positive glia (G,H) in the hindbrain of hdac1hi1618sibling and mutant embryos at (A,B) 26, (C,D) 34 and (E-H) 38 hpf. Although the efficiency of neurone formation is reduced there is a progressive increase in the number of Hupositive neurones in the hindbrain of hdac1hi1618mutants between 26 and 38 hpf. However, these neurones are arranged in continuous longitudinal tracts extending through the hindbrain and a segmented arrangement is not adopted. Glia also fail to adopt their characteristic arrangement in each rhombomere and instead accumulate aberrantly in the anterior hindbrain.
