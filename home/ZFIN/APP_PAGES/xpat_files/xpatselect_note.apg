<p>ZFIN now displays three kinds of gene expression data:</p>

<ol>
<li>  annotated images that have been directly submitted to ZFIN by
researchers.
<li>  annotated figures from the current literature. Images and captions are displayed when copyright permissions are available. 
<li> an index of gene expression data from older publications
</ol>

<p>ZFIN began to include published figures in 2004.  We are currently
able to add figures from older publications only on an ad hoc basis.
A more complete incorporation of figures from the older literature is
a long-term goal.</p>

<p>
To find transgenic fish with GFP expression, go to the <a href="/<!--|WEBDRIVER_PATH_FROM_ROOT|-->?MIval=aa-fishselect.apg"> Mutants/Transgenics</a> search page,
<ol>
<li> enter GFP (or RFP, YFP etc.) in the Gene/Allele name field
<li> select "Show only transgenics" under Filters
<li> enter any desired anatomical structures in the anatomy area
</ol>

<p>If you have questions or suggestions or would like to submit
expression pattern images to ZFIN, please <a href="mailto:zfinadmn@zfin.org">contact us</a>. </p>
