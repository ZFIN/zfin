<p>ZFIN now displays three kinds of gene expression data:</p>

<ol>
<li>  annotated images that have been directly submitted to ZFIN by
researchers.
<li>  annotated figures from the current literature. Images and captions are displayed when copyright permissions are available. 
<li> an index of gene expression data from older publications
</ol>

<p>ZFIN began to include published figures in 2004.  We are currently
able to add figures from older publications only on an ad hoc basis.
A more complete incorporation of figures from the older literature is
a long-term goal.</p>

<p>
Reporter gene constructs can employ a variety of different engineered foreign genes.  If, for example, a search for GFP expression yields no results, try RFP, YFP etc.  For a full list, see
<a href="/<!--|WEBDRIVER_PATH_FROM_ROOT|-->?MIval=aa-markerselect.apg&marker_type=EFG&query_results=t"> all current EFG's</a>

<p>If you have questions or suggestions or would like to submit
expression pattern images to ZFIN, please <a href="mailto:zfinadmn@zfin.org">contact us</a>. </p>
