</B></FONT><FONT FACE="New York"><P> ZFIN maintains information about mutations including the phenotype, map location, mutagen, parental lineage, and current source for most lines, although the information on some mutants is still incomplete.  Many mutant records also include one or more high-resolution images illustrating the phenotype at various developmental stages and/or orientations.  </P>
<P>Details:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<U><P>Number of mutations</U>: about 2000</P>
<U><P>Number of images</U>: 2043</P>
<U><P>Coverage:</U>  We have attempted to list all known zebrafish mutations, including those produced in screens at Oregon, MGH, and Tuebingen. Some mutations may still be missing, either because we have been unable to collect information on them, or because the information has not yet been made publically available.<P>
<U><P>Completeness:</U>  The completeness of information varies from mutation to mutation, ranging from nothing but allele designation to more or less complete records including one or more images.  For most mutations, there is at least a description of the phenotype and  the mutation&#146;s origins. </P>
The images associated with mutations are only sparsely described. We plan to classify images by the anatomical structures shown as well as orientation, age, specimen type and so on; for most images, only developmental stage is listed at this time.<P>
<U><P>Accuracy:</U>  We have tried to ensure the accuracy of ZFIN data. Nevertheless, there are errors.  Please contact us if you find errors. Ultimately, the completeness and quality of the data in ZFIN depend on the commitment of the research community.</P>

<P>One of the most powerful features of the mutation search interface is that it allows keyword search using a predefined set of defects.  The interface that implements this feature is a Java applet that allows you to browse and select keywords from the predefined list.  We have found that, although the applet seems to work fine on all tested platforms, some platforms (notably Netscape 3 on Macintosh) may require you to quit Netscape, increase its memory allocation, and then restart Netscape. You will know this problem has occurred when the applet appears, but contains no list of keywords to select. Also, note that the applet may take a few moments to appear, particularly on slower computers.</P>


<FONT FACE="New York"><P>Please report erroneous data, interface bugs, and other problems by sending email to <A HREF="mailto:zfinadmn@zfin.org">zfinadmn@zfin.org</A>.  A convenient shortcut is the "questions and comments" button at the top left of every ZFIN screen, which automatically starts an email to the design team.  </P>
<p>
ZFIN has been established as the official nomenclature clearing house for the zebrafish research community. Automated registration of new nomenclature (e.g. locus names, abbreviations, allele designations), as well as regularly updated <A HREF=" http://zfin.org/zf_info/nomen.html">nomenclature conventions</A> are available. Please direct nomenclature questions to <A HREF="mailto:zfinadmn@zfin.org">the ZFIN data curator</A>.
