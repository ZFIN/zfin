<p>ZFIN now displays two kinds of phenotype data:</p>

<ol>
<li>  annotated figures from the current literature. Images and captions are displayed when copyright permissions are available.
<li>  submitted images and annotations that have been electronically derived from older data in ZFIN.
</ol>

<p>ZFIN began to include published figures in 2004 and to annotate detailed phenotype information in 2006. We are currently able to add figures from older publications only on an ad hoc basis. A more complete incorporation of figures from the older literature is a long-term goal.

<p>If you have questions or suggestions or would like to submit phenotype data or images to ZFIN, please contact us.
