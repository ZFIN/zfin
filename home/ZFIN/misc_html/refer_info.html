        <b>Exporting from ZFIN in REFER format</b>
    </div>
    <div class="popup-body">
        <p>
            <b>Purpose:</b> These instructions give details on how to export selected references from ZFIN in REFER
            format, to be subsequently imported into your favorite bibliographic utility.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Disclaimer:</b> ZFIN is not and was never meant to be a bibliographic database (e.g., like PubMed). The
            primary purpose of having publications in ZFIN is so that these records can be linked to the various
            experimental data we will be supporting. However,  we do recognize that many users will want to move
            publications found in ZFIN to their personal bibliographic utilities; the "export REFER format" link is our
            response to this need.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because ZFIN is not a true bibliographic facility, it can not export completely polished REFER files. You
            will almost certainly have to edit the references individually after you have imported them into your
            bibliographic utility. The editing may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Separating out the authors.</b> ZFIN does not store author names individually; references all
                    show up with one big "author entry", which will contain the entire list of authors. Your
                    bibliographic program may want you to separate them out.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Special Characters.</b> Some platforms do not deal with special characters like umlauts and
                    tildes very well; you may have to edit them back into references by hand.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Reference Types.</b> ZFIN does not know about reference types (e.g. books versus journals versus
                    conference proceedings). The import facilities for most bibliographic utilies we've tested will
                    treat all entries produced by this facility as "Journal Articles".
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In sum, using this facility is not effortless. However, it should be a big improvement over manual entry,
            or cut-and-paste methodologies, particularly  for larger numbers of references.
        </p>

            <b>Instructions:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Click the "REFER format file" button. This should case your browser to display a message asking where
                to save the file on your machine. Enter a name and save the file.
            </li>
            <li>
                (may be optional for some platforms). There is often confusion of "returns" and "line feeds" across
                different machines. If such an incompatibility exists, your machine may have trouble reading the file
                you just saved. The easiest way to avoid any problem is to load the file into your favorite word
                processor (e.g. MS Word), specifying "text only" format. Make some small change to the file (e.g.
                remove a blank line from  the beginning), then save the changes. In doing this, you word processor will
                likely put in whatever line-ending markers are appropriate for your machine. Quit your word processor.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now open your bibliographic program (e.g. Endnote) and "import" the  file you just saved, specifying
                "REFER" format. It should create new references for each imported entry.
            </li>
            <li>
                Edit the new reference entries as described earlier.
            </li>
        </ol>
