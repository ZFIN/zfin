<A NAME="browsers">
<big>Required Browser Capabilities</big>.<br>
To create a dynamic, user-friendly ZFIN interface, we employed several relatively advanced WWW technologies. This means that your browser software must support these technologies to access ZFIN effectively.
<p>
Here are our recommendations:
<ul>
<li><b>Netscape</b>. <font size=-1> We recommend Netscape Navigator, <b>version 3 or later</b>. This is the only browser guaranteed to be fully capable of displaying the ZFIN interface. Older versions of Netscape do not support all features and will have problems. <br>
 You may <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com">contact Netscape</a> to download the browser; if you are affiliated with an educational institution, the software is free.<br>
 Once you have Netscape version 3.0 or higher, be sure that you have enabled both Java and Javascript. To do this, pull down the OPTIONS menu and select "Network Preferences", then click on "Languages"; select the Javascript and Java options.</font> 
<li><b>Microsoft Internet Explorer</b>. <font size=-1>We recommend Internet Explorer, <b>version 5 or later</b>. </font>  You may <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">contact Microsoft</a> to download the browser.  Be sure that you have enabled both Java and Javascript. 
<li><b>Other browsers</b>. <font size=-1>In principle, any browser that supports Javascript should be able to access most of the site. Some specialized activities like image annotation and manipulation of the genetic map also require support for Java applets.</font>
</ul>
<p>

<LI><A NAME="login">
<big>Problems logging in.</big> <br>
 If you have trouble logging in -- ZFIN repeatedly tells you that there is an error in your login, even when you're SURE you've typed you name and password correctly -- you may be using a browser version that has minor problems with caching.  Your browser <i>caches</i> (i.e. "remembers") pages that you have recently viewed. Normally, this is a good thing, avoiding a waste of time reloading the page when you revisit the page. But it can sometimes be a problem when interacting with a database like ZFIN. Specifically, your browser may return a cached page denying your login, rather than passing your login request to ZFIN; this makes it look like ZFIN is rejecting your login!  To avoid this, go to "Network Preferences" in your browser (where this appears varies by browser and browser version). Under "Verify Document", select "Every Time".  This will force your browser to check whether a page has been updated before returning an older cached version of the page.
<p>
In addition, ZFIN login requires that cookies be enabled on your browser.  You will receive a warning message if you attempt to login with cookies disabled.  Set your browser to accept cookies and follow the login procedure again.
<p>

<LI><A NAME="forgotten">  
<BIG>Forgotten Password</big> <br>  
If you are unable to remember your password, Write to Pat Edwards (edwards@uoneuro.uoregon.edu) and request that she reset your password.
<p>


<li>
<A NAME="screen> <Big>Maximize Screen Space</big>. <br>
Many of the ZFIN data displays and entry forms are too large to fit on a single screen of an average computer display. To make viewing easier, we recommend that you maximize the screen real estate available to ZFIN by:

<ol>
<li> Resizing your browser's screen to fill your screen completely.
<li> Setting your browser (under the OPTIONS menu) to hide the toolbar, directory buttons and current URL (location), which are all taking up space at the top of your browser window.
</ol>

<p>
<li>
<A NAME="color"><big>Full color support</big>. <br>
Many of the images available in ZFIN contain more than 256 colors. To ensure data integrity, set the color depth of your screen to 24 or 32 bits (i.e. "thousands" or "millions" of colors).
<p>

<li><A NAME="cookie">
<big> Turn off browser security features.</big> <br>
Some browsers can be configured to be extremely conservative with respect to security. For instance, Netscape can be configured to issue a security warning every time you submit information to an "insecure" (i.e. non-encrypted) WWW server. This can be very tedious and irritating, especially because the security risks involved are negligible. While interacting with ZFIN, you will want to switch off the security reminder function; otherwise you will get a reminder every time you submit a query or other information to ZFIN. To disable this feature, select "Security Preferences" under the OPTIONS menu, then click on "General" within the resulting dialog. Under the "Show an alert before:" heading, de-select the "Submitting a form insecurely" option.
 <p>

<li><A NAME="links">
<big> Linking directly to a ZFIN record.</big> <br>
It is often desirable to link directly to a ZFIN record from an outside WWW page; clicking the link will jump directly to that record within ZFIN.<br>  Because ZFIN is a complex site, just setting a bookmark using your browser won't work; such a bookmark will merely take you to the ZFIN home page. However, we have devised a mechanism that allows such linking:  All ZFIN records have a ZFIN id number, which is visible in the header of the record when you view it.  To link to a record, simply note down its ZFIN_id, then append it to the URL:
<pre>http://zfin.org/cgi-bin/ZFIN_jump?record=</pre>
Loading this URL will start ZFIN and display the target record.
<p>
<li><A NAME="publications">
<big>Publications</big> <br>
Every reference for journal articles, book chapters, books, reviews, abstracts, movies, etc., relating to zebrafish... not just zebrafish research... that we've found in our literature searches, have been entered into ZFIN. This 
is meant to be an all-encompassing publication list not limited to the peer reviewed papers that you would normally include in a CV.  If you prefer that we delete your publication that is not a peer reviewed article, we will delete it at your request.
<p>
ZFIN does not maintain "in press" publications. Once a paper is published we should pick it up through literature searches and enter it within a week or so of it's publication.
<p>
<li><A NAME="lab">

<big>Adding Lab Members</big> <br>A new lab member must have an individual ZFIN record before they may be added to your lab.  "Adding" is just a matter of linking the personal record to your lab record.  It's a common misconception. When you wish to add a link for someone who is not in ZFIN, write Pat Edwards (edwards@uoneuro.uoregon.edu) 
and request a record be set up for them. She will link them to your lab for you.
<p>
To add those who do have records to your lab record, press the "add" button in your lab editing screen. At the prompt, type in the person's last name. When the search brings up a list of similar names, select the correct one and that person will automatically be linked to your record. Finally, you'll have to select the person's position title from the menu beside his/her name.
<p>
