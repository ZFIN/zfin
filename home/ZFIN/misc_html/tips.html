<big>Required Browser Capabilities</big>.<br>
To create a dynamic, user-friendly ZFIN interface, we employed several relatively advanced WWW technologies. This means that your browser software must support these technologies to access ZFIN effectively.
<p>
Here are our recommendations:
<ul>
<li><b>Netscape</b>. <font size=-1> We recommend Netscape Navigator, <b>version 3 or later</b>. This is the only browser guaranteed to be fully capable of displaying the ZFIN interface. Older versions of Netscape do not support all features and will have problems. <br>
 You may <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com">contact Netscape</a> to download the browser; if you are affiliated with an educational institution, the software is free.<br>
 Once you have Netscape3.0, be sure that you have enabled both Java and Javascript. To do this, pull down the OPTIONS menu and select "Network Preferences", then click on "Languages"; select the Javascript and Java options.</font> 
<li><b>Microsoft Internet Explorer</b>. <font size=-1> Based on limited testing (using version 2.0), we have found that Internet Explorer <b>does not</b> provide proper support for the advanced interface features of the ZFIN site. You may be able to access some information, but will not be able to move effectively between pages within the ZFIN site. </font>
<li><b>Other browsers</b>. <font size=-1>In principle, any browser that supports Javascript should be able to access most of the site. Some specialized activities like image annotation and manipulation of the genetic map also require support for Java applets.</font>
</ul>
<p>

<LI><A NAME="login">
<big>Problems logging in.</big>  If you have trouble logging in -- ZFIN repeatedly tells you that there is an error in your login, even when you're SURE you've typed your name and password correctly -- you may be using a version of Netscape that has minor problems with caching.  Your Netscape browser <i>caches</i> (i.e., "remembers") pages that you have recently viewed. Normally, this is a good thing, avoiding a waste of time reloading the page when you revisit the page. But it can sometimes be a problem when interacting with a database like ZFIN. Specifically, your browser may return a cached page denying your login, rather than passing your login request to ZFIN; this makes it look like ZFIN is rejecting your login!  To avoid this, go to "Network Preferences" in your browser (where this appears varies by Netscape version). Under "Verify Document", select "Every Time".  This will force your browser to check whether a page has been updated before returning an older cached version of the page.
<p>

<li><A NAME="back">
<big>Avoid the Netscape "BACK" button</big>. We have found that using the Netscape BACK button is unreliable (and may even crash your machine!) in versions of Netscape prior to 4.01, due to a bug in the Netscape browser. In any case, we have provided a task-sensitive navigation tool that is far superior to the Netscape BACK button; just look for the "Path" tiles that appear along the left side of the workspace. We recommend that you use these tiles to move about within ZFIN, and avoid using the BACK button altogether.

<p>


<li>
<A NAME="screen"> <Big>Maximize Screen Space</big>. <br>
Many of the ZFIN data displays and entry forms are too large to fit on a single screen of an average computer display. To make viewing easier, we recommend that you maximize the screen real estate available to ZFIN by:

<ol>
<li> Resizing your browser's screen to fill your screen completely.
<li> Setting your browser (under the OPTIONS menu) to hide the toolbar, directory buttons and current URL (location), which are all taking up space at the top of your browser window.
</ol>

<p>
<li>
<A NAME="color"><big>Full color support</big>. <br>
Many of the images available in ZFIN contain more than 256 colors. To ensure data integrity, set the color depth of your screen to 24 or 32 bits (i.e. "thousands" or "millions" of colors).
<p>
<li><A NAME="cookie">
<big> Turn off browser security features.</big> <br>
Some browsers can be configured to be extremely conservative with respect to security. For instance, Netscape can be configured to issue a security warning every time you submit information to an "insecure" (i.e. non-encrypted) WWW server. This can be very tedious and irritating, especially because the security risks involved are negligible. While interacting with ZFIN, you will want to switch off the security reminder function; otherwise you will get a reminder every time you submit a query or other information to ZFIN. To disable this feature, select "Security Preferences" under the OPTIONS menu, then click on "General" within the resulting dialog. Under the "Show an alert before:" heading, de-select the "Submitting a form insecurely" option.
 <p>

<li><A NAME="links">
<big> Linking directly to a ZFIN record.</big> <br>
It is often desirable to link directly to a ZFIN record from an outside WWW page; clicking the link will jump directly to that record within ZFIN.<P>  Because ZFIN is a complex site, just setting a bookmark using your browser won't work; such a bookmark will merely take you to the ZFIN home page. However, we have devised a mechanism that allows such linking:  All ZFIN records have a ZFIN id number, which is visible in the header of the record when you view it.  To link to a record, simply note down its ZFIN_id, then append it to the URL:
<pre>http://zfin.org/<!--|CGI_BIN_DIR_NAME|-->/ZFIN_jump?record=</pre>
Loading this URL will start ZFIN and display the target record.

</ul>
