        <ol>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
                <span class="bold">Construct:</span> Enter one or more terms. Terms can include part or all of a construct name. Your search terms will be compared to transgenic constructs and previous names.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
                <span class="bold">Promoter:</span>Searches constructs in which a promoter, or regulatory region, has been designated.
            <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
                <span class="bold">Coding Sequence:</span>Searches constructs in which a coding sequence, or expressed gene, has been designated
            <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
                <span class="bold">Inserted in Gene:</span>Searches constructs that have been shown to be inserted in a specific gene
            <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
                <span class="bold">Reporter Expression in:</span>Typing in this field will auto-complete with suggested terms from the Zebrafish Anatomical Ontology. The search will find constructs that have reporter expression annotated to the term entered.
            <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
                <span class="bold">All Constructs:</span>This is checked by default and searches against all transgenic constructs, including enhancer trap, gene trap and promoter trap constructs.
            <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
                <span class="bold">Transgenic Construct:</span>Limits your search to transgenic constructs.
            <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
                <span class="bold">Enhancer Trap Construct:</span>Limits your search to constructs that are enhancer trap constructs.
            <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
                <span class="bold">Gene Trap Construct:</span>Limits your search to constructs that are gene trap constructs
            <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
                <span class="bold">Promoter Trap Construct:</span>Limits your search to constructs that are promoter trap constructs.
