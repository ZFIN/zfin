<!-- FILE: blank.html -->

<!-- This file is important; don't delete it, even though it does nothing but display a blank page. This is useful for when you want to display a blank frame. Due to a bug in NETSCAPE, it ignores frames without SRC attributes. So the only way to get a blank frame is to point it at a blank file
