        <ol>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
                <span class="bold">Gene/Allele:</span> Enter one or more terms.
                Type at least two characters for each term.
                Your search terms will be compared to alleles, transgenic lines,
                morpholinos, transgenic constructs and their associated genes.
                Previous names will also be searched - e.g. "krox20" will match mutants and knockdowns of the gene egr2b.
                Matches are by "begins with" but not "contained in".
                As a result, "shh gfp" (without quotes) will return shha and shhb mutants / knockdowns
                in transgenic fish that have GFP in the construct,
                but not alleles or knockdowns of the hypothetical gene "abcshh" or transgenics with EGFP.
                <ul>
                    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Note:</span> To find transgenic fish with any fluorescent
                        reporter gene - GFP, EGFP, Kaede etc., enter "fluorescent" or "fluorescent protein" in the gene
                        / allele field.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
                <span class="bold">Phenotype:</span> Enter terms one at a time in the Phenotype field.
                Typing in this field will auto-complete with suggested terms from the Zebrafish Anatomical Ontology (kidney, brain ...)
                and from the Gene Ontology (mitosis, mitochondrion ...).
                The search will find Fish that have phenotypes in EVERY term you enter (i.e. this is an "AND" search).
                Fish with phenotypes in substructures are returned as well - a search for brain will return fish that
                have phenotypes in the cerebellum.

                <ul>
                    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Note:</span> ZFIN does not record phenotypes for reporter gene
                        expression in an otherwise normal anatomical structure (e.g. GFP in a morphologically normal
                        heart). To find fish with reporter gene expression in a structure, go to the Gene Expression
                        Search page, enter the anatomy structure in the Anatomy Terms field and select the option: "Show
                        only reporter genes in transgenic fish".

                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
                <span class="bold">Sorting your results:</span>
                Search results are Fish - the combination of a genotype with morpholinos. Three different sorting
                schemes can be selected from the "Sort by" pull-down menu at the top-left of the results.
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="bold">Fish (Best Match):</span> the default sorting order, optimized for exact
                        matches in simpler fish.
		    <li><span class="bold">Mutant/MO gene:</span> single mutant/knockdowns first, then doubles etc.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Line/MO:</span> single allele/transgenic lines first, then doubles etc.
                        etc.
                    </li>
                </ul>
