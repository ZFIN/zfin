        <ol>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
                <span class="bold">Gene/Allele Name:</span> Enter one or more terms.
                Type at least two characters for each term.
                Your search terms will be compared to alleles, transgenic
                lines, morpholinos, transgenic constructs and their associated genes. Previous names will also be
                searched - e.g. "krox20" will match mutants and morphants of the gene egr2b. Matches are by "begins
                with" but not "contained in". As a result, "shh gfp" (without quotes) will return shha and shhb mutants
                / morphants in transgenic fish that have GFP in the construct, but not alleles or morphants of the
                hypothetical gene "abcshh" or transgenics with EGFP.
                <ul>
                    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Note:</span> To find transgenic fish with any fluorescent
                        reporter gene - GFP, EGFP, Kaede etc., enter "fluorescent" or "fluorescent protein" in the gene
                        / allele field.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
                <span class="bold">Phenotype Anatomy:</span> Enter anatomy terms one at a time in the Phenotype Anatomy
                field. Typing in this field will auto-complete with suggested structures from the zebrafish anatomical
                ontology. The search will find Fish that have phenotypes in EVERY structure you enter (i.e. this is an
                "AND" search). Fish with phenotypes in substructures are returned as well - a search for brain will
                return fish that have phenotypes in the cerebellum.
                <ul>
                    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Note:</span> ZFIN does not record phenotypes for reporter gene
                        expression in an otherwise normal anatomical structure (e.g. GFP in a morphologically normal
                        heart). To find fish with reporter gene expression in a structure, go to the Gene Expression
                        Search page, enter the anatomy structure in the Anatomy Terms field and select the option: "Show
                        only reporter genes in transgenic fish".

                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
                <span class="bold">Sorting your results:</span>
                Search results are Fish - the combination of a genotype with morpholinos. Three different sorting
                schemes can be selected from the "Sort by" pull-down menu at the top-left of the results.
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="bold">Fish (Best Match):</span> the default sorting order, optimized for exact
                        matches in simpler fish.
		    <li><span class="bold">Mutant/MO gene:</span> single mutant/morphants first, then doubles etc.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Line/MO:</span> single allele/transgenic lines first, then doubles etc.
                        etc.
                    </li>
                </ul>
