    Professional Opportunities with ZFIN
</h2>
<p>
    The ZFIN team periodically seeks candidates to work on the rapidly expanding Zebrafish Model Organism Database (zfin.org), our web-based database application providing curated, high-quality research information to the international biological research community.
<p></p>
Zebrafish research data are widely used to increase our understanding of human development and disease, and ZFIN helps enable this work.   A great <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/about/press/2013/130417.html">video</a> detailing the importance of zebrafish research to human disease modeling is available on the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute's website.
