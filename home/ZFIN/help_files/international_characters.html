<bIG>Searching for names with non-English characters</BIG>
<p>
Many ZFIN author names include non-English characters (umlauts, accents, etc.). Currently, the ZFIN search mechanism does not recognize full spellings that do not include these characters (i.e. to search out publications by Uwe Strähle, you must use the umlauted 
ä in the name; ZFIN will not find spellings of strahle or straehle). If you fail to find a name that should be listed in ZFIN, try the following alternate searches:
<UL>
<LI>  in publication searches, search for a co-author name instead
<LI>  in people searches, use the person's first name
<LI>  search with a portion of the name (i.e. hle)
<LI>  use the proper character in your search (i.e. Orbán, Nüsslein-Volhard, 
Strähle, etc.)
</UL>
<p>
If all else fails, contact <a href="mailto:zfinadmn@zfin.org">Jonathan Knight</a> for help with your search.
