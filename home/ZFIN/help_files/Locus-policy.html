</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><FONT FACE="New York"><P> The following policy has been established by the zebrafish research community to govern the assignment of locus and allele designations.  The goals are to ensure that unique names are given to each new locus and allele and that the name conform to <A HREF="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt7/7.1.html">nomenclature</A> conventions for zebrafish. 
</P>

<P>The following procedure has been developed to govern the way in which ZFIN handles registration of locus/allele designations:</P>

<OL>

<LI>As you request new locus names, abbreviations, and allele designations, ZFIN checks the database for existing mutations with the same name, abbreviation  or allele designation.  You are notified if a conflict exists. This feedback allows you to construct a unique combination of locus name, abbreviation, and allele designation.</LI>
<LI>After the new (and unique) entry is submitted to ZFIN, the locus name and/or allele designation is temporarily reserved pending final approval. The proposed name/designation is then forwarded to a nomenclature committee for additional approval including verification that the entry conforms to established nomenclature conventions.  The committee may also consider whether the name is appropriate with respect to related names in other species.</LI>
<LI>If the committee finds a problem with the proposed name, you will be notified by email. The committee will likely propose a suitable resolution as well. </LI>
<LI>If the entry is acceptable, you will be granted a <I>conditional reservation</I> for the locus name, abbreviation and allele designation you have registered.  The terms of a conditional reservation are as follows:</LI></OL>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<B><P>*</B> The  allele designation is <B>permanently</B> reserved in your name.  Regardless of what eventually happens with respect to the locus name and abbreviation (see below), the allele designation is assigned forever.</P>
<B><P>*</B> The locus name and abbreviation will be reserved in your name for a period of three months. After this time, you will be sent an email reminder, asking you to submit the mutation to ZFIN officially, minimally including the publication in which it appeared.  If you have not yet published the mutation, you may extend your reservation for an additional three months by stating that you are still pursuing the mutation, e.g., a publication is in preparation.</P>
<P>* If after six months you still have not entered a ZFIN record that includes an associated publication, your reservation will expire; the locus name and abbreviation are removed from ZFIN, making them available to the community to be used in naming future mutations.  As emphasized above, the allele designation is permanently assigned and does not expire; it merely becomes an &quot;un-named&quot; allele.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>In practical terms, a conditional reservation means that a ZFIN record is created for the mutation; the ZFIN accession number generated may serve as &quot;evidence&quot; that the new name has been officially sanctioned.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="New York"><P>We believe that this policy strikes a fair balance between the interests of the individual scientist and those of the community as a whole.
