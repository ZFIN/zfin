            ZFIN displays three kinds of gene expression data:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>annotated images that have been directly submitted to ZFIN by researchers.</li>
            <li>annotated figures from the current literature. Images and captions are displayed when copyright permissions are available.</li>
            <li>an index of gene expression data from older publications.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            ZFIN began to include published figures in 2004. Figures from older publications are added on an ad hoc
            basis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reporter gene constructs can employ a variety of different engineered foreign genes. If, for example, an
            expression search for GFP expression yields no results, try RFP, YFP etc. For a full list, see 
            <a href="/search?q=&fq=category%3A%22Gene+%2F+Transcript%22&category=Gene+%2F+Transcript&fq=type_1%3A%22Engineered+Foreign+Gene%22">all current EFGs</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <a href="/search?q=&fq=category%3A%22Reporter+Line%22&category=Reporter+Line">single box search
            “Reporter Lines” category</a> is another way to locate lines expressing reporter genes.
