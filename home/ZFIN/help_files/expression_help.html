            ZFIN displays three kinds of gene expression data:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>annotated images that have been directly submitted to ZFIN by researchers.</li>
            <li>annotated figures from the current literature. Images and captions are displayed when copyright permissions are available.</li>
            <li>an index of gene expression data from older publications.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            ZFIN began to include published figures in 2004. Figures from older publications are added on an ad hoc
            basis.

            The ribbon view represents a high-level summary of gene expression in a wild-type background.
