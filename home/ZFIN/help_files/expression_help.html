            ZFIN displays three kinds of gene expression data:
</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Annotated images that have been directly submitted to ZFIN by researchers.</li>
            <li>Annotated figures from the current literature. Images and captions are displayed when copyright permissions are available.</li>
            <li>An index of gene expression data from older publications.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            ZFIN began to include published figures in 2004. Figures from older publications are added on an ad hoc
            basis.

            The ribbon view represents a high-level summary of gene expression in a wild-type background.
            Click on a shaded box in the ribbon to view the corresponding detailed expression annotations.
            Unfilled boxes in the ribbon indicate that there are no annotations currently available in ZFIN. An unfilled box does not imply the absence of expression in the structures or stages listed in the ribbon.
