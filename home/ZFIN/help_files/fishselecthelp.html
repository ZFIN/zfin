<bIG>Description of categories used to search for ZFIN mutant and wild_type lines.</BIG>

<p>


<A NAME="allele">
<U><BIG> Allele name</BIG></U> <br> Use this criterion to search on the official name of a mutant allele.  Type as little or as much of the name as you like; all mutants with names containing the given text string will be returned.
<p>


<A NAME="locus">
<U><BIG>Locus name </BIG></U>  <br> Use this criterion to search on the name of a locus of interest. Type as little or as much of the name as you like; all mutants with names containing the given text string will be returned.<p>

<A NAME="abbrev">
<U><BIG>Abbreviation</BIG></U> <br> Use this criterion to search on the offical three letter abbreviation of mutations. This match is exact, character for character. For example, you must enter 'cyc' to find 'cyc' alleles; entering only 'cy' will not yield these alleles.<p>

<A NAME="lg">
<U><BIG>Linkage Group (LG) </BIG></U>  <br> Use this criterion to focus your search on a particular linkage group. <p>


<A NAME="mtype">
<U><BIG>Mutation Type </BIG></U> <br> Use this criterion to focus your search on a particular kind of mutation, e.g., deletions (deficiencies) or translocations. <p>


<A NAME="mutagen">
<U><BIG> Mutagen</BIG></U> <br>  Use this criterion to constrain your search with respect to the mutagen used to generate the mutation, e.g., ENU, gamma rays, etc.   <p>

<A NAME="phenotype">
<U><BIG> Phenotype (and Comments, ZFIN_id)</BIG></U> <br> This multi-value criterion is available to allow you to search on a number of secondary fields, namely, phenotype description, comments and ZFIN_id.  Of these, phenotype description is likely the most useful.  Most mutations have a free-form descriptive paragraph associated with them, written by the discoverer of the mutation.  You may use this criterion to search for a specific word or phrase within this paragraph. The fundamental weakness of this criterion is the free-form nature of the description: different authors may use different language to describe similar phenotypes.  For this reason, ZFIN also supports keyword search, usinga closed, pre-defined set of keywords to classify mutations. Browsing and selection of these keywords is supported via the dictionary applet in the lower half of the criteria frame.<p>
 We strongly recommend that you the keyword applet as your primary tool for phenotypic searching; rely on the submitter's free-form description only as a last resort.<p>
By changing the selection in the pop-up menu from "phenotype" to "comments" or "ZFIN_id", you may search on these fields as well.  All of these searches offer partial matching; type as little or as much of the name as you like; all mutants with names containing the given text string will be returned.<p>


<A NAME="phenokeywords">
<U><BIG> Phenotype Keyword Selector</BIG></U>  <br>
Every mutation in ZFIN has been classified by the submitter using a closed, pre-defined set of phenotypic keywords.  The applet in the lower half of the criteria pane allows you to browse through this list, which is hierarchically organized, to select a group of keywords that describe the mutations you are interested in. <p>
To select an item from the left-hand pane, double-click it, or click once to highlight it and then click the ">>>" arrow to move it to the right hand pane. Selections in the right-hand pane can be deleted by moving then back to the left-hand pane. Note that the list in the left pane is hierarchical; expand levels by clicking the small black triangles.<p>
You may also select the logic used to connect the keywords you select: use the radio buttons at the bottom to select conjunctive or disjunctive search.
