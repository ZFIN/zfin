<A NAME="type"><b>STRAIN TYPE.</b></A> </TD><TD>What kind of new strain are you submitting?

</TD></TR><TR><TD>

<A NAME="availability"><b>AVAILABILITY.</b> </A> </TD><TD>Current status of strain. Where you can currently order a sample from.

<A NAME="name"><b>MUTANT ALLELE INFO.</b> </A> </TD><TD>If you are describing a new mutant, use the two buttons below to specify the abberant chromosomes carried by the mutant you are describing. Specify only chromosomes that differ (i.e. are mutated) from the wild type; any chromosomes not specified are assumed to be wild type.


</TD></TR><TR><TD>

<A NAME="breeding"><b>BREEDING.</b> </A> </TD><TD>Specify the genetic background of the new strain's parents, if they are known. Click the "specify" button for maternal and paternal strain to browse through existing strains in the database to select the appropriate parent.<p> For mutant strains, you should also specify the segregation of the cross, if known. For instance, a cyclops translocation might have a segregation of "15% cyc, 75% wild, 10% severe".<br> Obviously, segregation does not apply to wild type strains and should be left blank in that case.

<A NAME="discoverer"><b>DISCOVERER.</b> </A> </TD><TD>Specify the original discoverer of this new strain of fish, if known.  Mostly likely this will be you, the submitter.

</TD></TR><TR><TD>

<A NAME="orig_cross"><b>ORIGINAL CROSS NUMBER. </b></A> </TD><TD>If known, please specify the stock or cross identification number of the original cross that produced this fish. This information may be vital for tracking down information on the cross (e.g. lab notes) later.

</TD></TR><TR><TD>

<A NAME="phenotype"><b>COMPOSITE PHENOTYPE.</b> </A> </TD><TD>Phenotypic information for mutant strains is generally associated with the individual alleles (chromosome) specified for the fish --- each mutant allele may have a specific phenotype. However, it occassionally happens that the <i> combination </i> of several mutant alleles in a particular animal (i.e. double-mutation) results in enhancement or suppression effects in the phenotypes  of the individual alleles. In other cases, the phenotype of a mutant allele may be affected by the background in which it appears. <p>
Use this field to describe these sorts of composite enhancement or suppression effects. <b> DO NOT </b> use it to redundantly describe the phenotype of the individual allele(s) carried by the strain. <p>
In most cases, this field should be left blank.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>

<A NAME="publications"><b>PUBLICATIONS.</b> </A> </TD><TD>The "primary" publication refers to the publication in which this new strain of fish was first reported. You may specify only one primary publication. You may also specify as many "secondary" publications as you like, listing all publications in which further work on this strain was reported.
