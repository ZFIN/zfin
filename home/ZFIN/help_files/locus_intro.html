<b><big>Overview</big></b>.  This facility will check your proposed name for conflicts with existing names or nomenclature rules. If no conflicts are found, you will be prompted to submit the new name to the zebrafish nomenclature committee for final approval.  
The proposed name is reserved as soon as you submit it to the nomenclature committee. <p>
 If the proposed name is approved by the nomenclature committee, the allele designation is permanently assigned to you. If you have not yet published information on this mutant, the locus name and abbreviation are conditionally assigned to you for a period of up to six months. If you have not published by that time, the reservation may expire.  See the <A HREF="Locus-policy.html">ZFIN locus registration policy</a> for details. 
<p>
<B><BIG>Step-by-Step</BIG></b>.  Registering new locus and allele names is fast and easy:
<ol>
<li>Enter the proposed locus name, abbreviation, and allele designation in the form above. If you are registering a new allele of an existing locus, enter the information for the existing locus and the proposed allele designation. Please consult the <A TARGET=content HREF="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt7/7.1.html">zebrafish nomenclature guidelines </a> before choosing a new locus name; consult the <A TARGET=content HREF="/zf_info/zfbook/lab_desig.html">list of laboratory allele designations</A> to select the appropriate allele prefix.

<li>Click the appropriate button to begin the analysis. If you are registering a new locus name, click the "Register new locus and allele" button; if you are registering a new allele of an existing mutation, click the "Register new allele of existing locus" button.

<li> Review the results of the analysis appearing in this pane. 

<li>If no conflicts or nomenclature problems where found, you will be prompted to submit your proposed name to the nomenclature committee for final approval. If problems were found, you will need to change your proposed name before proceeding.
