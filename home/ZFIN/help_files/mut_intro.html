The criteria pane above includes a special applet for selecting phenotypic keywords, which appears in the lower half of the pane. Depending on your internet connection, Netscape version, and machine, this applet <b>may take anywhere from 3 seconds to a minute to load</b>; this delay should occur only the first time you visit the page. Please be patient.
<p>
Some versions of Netscape will also fail to display the applet properly under low memory conditions. If you see the applet, but it contains no list of keywords, you may need to allocate more memory to Netscape.
