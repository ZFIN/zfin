<div><h5>What do the different calculation methods mean?</h5><div>For each pairwise comparison of phenotypes from the query (q) and target (t), we can assess their individual similarities in a number of ways.  First, we find the phenotype-in-common between each pair (called the lowest common subsumer or LCS). Then, we can leverage the Information Content (IC) of the phenotypes (q,t,lcs) in a variety of combinations to interpret the strength of the similarity.</div><br /><div><b>**Uniqueness </b>reflects how often the phenotype-in-common is annotated to all diseases and genes in the Monarch Initiative knowledgebase.  This is simply a reflection of the IC normalized based on the maxIC. IC(PhenotypeInCommon)maxIC(AllPhenotypes)</div><br /><div><b>**Distance</b> is the euclidian distance between the query, target, and phenotype-in-common, computed using IC scores.<br/><center>d=(IC(q)-IC(lcs))2+(IC(t)-IC(lcs))2</center>  </div><br /><div>This is normalized based on the maximal distance possible, which would be between two rarely annotated leaf nodes that only have the root node (phenotypic abnormality) in common.  So what is depicted in the grid is 1-dmax(d)</div><br /><div><b>**Ratio(q)</b> is the proportion of shared information between a query phenotype and the phenotype-in-common with the target.<br /><center>ratio(q)=IC(lcs)IC(q)*100</center></div><br /><div><b>**Ratio(t)</b> is the proportion of shared information between the target phenotype and the phenotype-in-common with the query.<br /><center>ratio(t)=IC(lcs)IC(t)*100</center></div></div>
