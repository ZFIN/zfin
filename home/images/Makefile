#
# These directories contain icons/graphics that are available to both the
# static and dynamic web pages.  Images that are ZFIN specific tent to 
# be in the LOCAL subdirectory.
#
# This directory structure was the result of considating 4 directories
# into 2:
#
#  home/ZFIN/icons       went to home/images
#  home/zf_info/graphics went to home/images/LOCAL
#  home/graphics         went to home/images/LOCAL
#  home/ZFIN/gifs        went to home/images/LOCAL
#
# Note also that the Apache set of icons are also accessable via http through
# /icons.  That path is defined in the http.conf file.



# ---------------  Variable Definitions  --------------------------------

TOP = ../..
include $(TOP)/make.include

# This directory has a couple of things worth noting.  The first is the
# IMG_INDEX.html file, which claims to have been generated by the htmlimg.pl
# script.  IMG_INDEX.html is page that lists all of the icons in this 
# directory.  This file should not be copied to the target dir.
#
# Also, I can't find the htmlimg.pl script anywhere. If we ever do find it,
# this makefile should have a target for invoking it.
#
# Secondly, there are just a ton of gif files in this directory.  We could
# take a couple of approaches to handling them:
# 1. We could copy only the images that are actually in use.  This list is
#    much smaller than the total number of files in this directory.  This 
#    means that production would not have any unused images in the images 
#    directory.  However, I think the folks who update the static web pages
#    look in the images directory when they need an icon.  If we put only the
#    currently used images in the directory then we greatly limit their future
#    choices.
# 2. Enumerate all of the gifs in this makefile and then have this makefile
#    copy all of them.  Almost all other makefiles explicitly enumerate 
#    the files to be copied.
# 3. Use wildcards to suck up all the gifs in the directory, and then copy
#    all the ones that matched the wildcard.  This option is far less
#    tedious than option 2.
#
# This makefile (and the ones below it) use the third approach, wildcards.


TARGETDIR = $(TARGETROOT)/home/images

SUBDIRS = LOCAL ANIMATED ARROWS BACKGROUNDS BIG_ANIMATED FACES


# Tried to use wildcard function working, but it didn't work, so used
# shell() instead.  [Added jpg for fx mockups, this will have to go
#                    if we take those images out and no longer have
#                    any jpg files in the directory

STATICS := $(shell echo *.gif) $(shell echo *.jpg) $(shell echo *.png)
