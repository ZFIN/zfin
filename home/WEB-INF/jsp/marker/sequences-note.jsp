    <p>Data in this table reports zebrafish RNA, genomic and polypeptide sequences.  Nucleotide sequences are manually curated from publications or sequence databases and supplemented by a weekly load via a data exchange with NCBI.  Polypeptide sequences are loaded weekly via data exchange with NCBI and a bimonthly data exchange with UniProt.  Lengths of sequences are added by the loads.  Analysis tools for each sequence can be accessed in a pulldown menu.</p>
    <p>
    The Sequence Overview presents the longest RefSeq or best available sequence for each of the RNA, genomic or polypeptide sequence types. Selecting the All Sequences option provides the user with the set of all sequences annotated to the gene.
