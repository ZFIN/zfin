        This automated gene description is a product of the Alliance of Genome Resources (Alliance; <a
            href="http://www.alliancegenome.org">Alliance of Genome Resources</a>), and is displayed on the Alliance web
        site and at ZFIN.

    <p>
        The Alliance developed an algorithm that uses the different types of curated gene data provided by member databases to generate a short human readable text summary. This algorithm uses
        structured data such as gene associations to Gene Ontology (GO) terms, Disease Ontology (DO) terms, wild-type expression annotations and the Alliance stringent orthology set to generate gene
        descriptions. The stringent orthology set has the primary criterion of an ortholog called by three or more methods is included if it is a best count or a best reverse count. The second
        criterion is that an ortholog predicted by ZFIN or HGNC is always included, regardless of count and an ortholog called by two methods is included if it is both a best count and a best reverse
        count. The Alliance orthology data is available at <a href="http://www.alliancegenome.org">Alliance of Genome Resources</a>.
        The algorithm was formulated to maximize information content and is designed to balance readability of a gene description with the amount
        of information provided.
