   Automated Gene Description

    This automated gene description is a product of the Alliance of Genome Resources (Alliance; <a href="http://www.alliancegenome.org"> www.alliancegenome.org </a>), and is displayed on the Alliance web site and at ZFIN.
<br>
    The Alliance developed an algorithm that uses the different types of curated gene data provided by member databases to  generate a short human readable text summary.
    This algorithm uses structured data such as gene associations to Gene Ontology (GO) terms, Disease Ontology (DO) terms and the Alliance strict orthology set to generate gene descriptions.
    The algorithm was formulated as a set covering problem and solved with a 'greedy' algorithm and is designed to balance readability of a gene description with the amount of information provided.
