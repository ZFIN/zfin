    The Marker Relationships section displays the relationships between genes and various DNA and cDNA sequences. The genomic sequences are usually clones such as bacterial artificial chromosome constructs (BAC)s, PACs or Fosmids produced for the Sanger zebrafish genome sequencing project, small segments such as SSLPs, SNPs, BAC/PAC ends, or are coding sequences like ESTs, cDNAs or sequence-tagged sites (STSs) from expression screens, the Zebrafish Gene Collection and recombination based mapping efforts.

    <p>
    These markers are displayed in a table with the relationship to the gene. The gene has the relationship 'contained in' when it is a smaller part of a sequence segment representing a larger piece of DNA (such as a BAC) and an 'encodes' relationship when a cDNA or EST is a smaller part of the coding sequence of the whole gene. The markers are linked to the corresponding ZFIN marker pages or the NCBI nucleotide sequence accession at Genbank.
