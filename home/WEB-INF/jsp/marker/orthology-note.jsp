    Data in this table reports orthology between zebrafish, human, mouse and fly.  All orthology assertions are manually curated and supported by evidence attributed to a specific reference(s).
    Gene symbols, location and accession numbers are loaded weekly via a data exchange with NCBI.  Orthology data may be downloaded to a CSV file.
