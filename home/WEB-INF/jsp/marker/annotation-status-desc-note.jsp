    Annotation Status Description
</div>
<div class="popup-body">
    <p>
        Annotation status describes the extent of information available from NCBI about the annotation of the gene in the assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
        CURRENT: Indicates that the gene has been annotated in the latest genome assembly (GRCz12tu) and can be viewed in a genome browser.
    </p>
    <p>
        NOT IN CURRENT ANNOTATION RELEASE: Indicates that the gene has not been placed in the latest genome assembly and is possibly an annotation artifact from an older genome assembly. This gene and
        associated data may possibly be withdrawn or archived
    </p>
    <p>
        NO STATUS: There is currently insufficient information or curation to conclusively determine the location of this gene or gene model in the latest genome assembly (GRCz12tu). This gene may
        have been annotated in GRCz11 or earlier assemblies or identified in a publication or large scale mutagenesis screens.
