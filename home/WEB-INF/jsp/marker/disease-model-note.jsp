    Note of Experimental Models Data
</div>
<div class="popup-body">
    Data in this table represents disease terms associated to a gene via experimental disease models, which contain a Fish associated with the gene.
    <p>This data is inferred when the experimental model is reported in the literature as a Fish containing a single affected gene and maintained in Standard or Generic-control conditions. Disease Ontology terms are linked to term pages that provide more information about the disease term. Fish names are linked to the Fish page, which provides additional gene expression and phenotype data associated to the Fish.</p>

    <p>For more information on disease model annotation please see <a href="/ZDB-PUB-170827-14">Bradford et al., 2017</a>.</p>
