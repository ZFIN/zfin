    The protein domain data in ZFIN come from InterPro and are updated monthly.
    The data are divided into two sections; <b>Domain, Family, and Site Summary</b> and <b>Domain Details Per Protein</b>.
    The Domain, Family, and Site Summary includes a simple listing of InterPro binding sites, domains, and families associated with products of the gene.
    The Domain Details Per Protein section shows which domain/site/family is associated with each specific protein product of the gene.
