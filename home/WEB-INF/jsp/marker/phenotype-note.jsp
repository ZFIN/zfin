    ZFIN annotates phenotype data using the Phenotype and Trait Ontology (PATO), the Zebrafish Anatomical Ontology (ZFA), and the Gene Ontology (GO). Phenotype data is annotated from figures in the current literature, as well as data that is directly submitted to ZFIN.

    <p>
        The ribbon view represents a high-level phenotype summary for mutant and gene knockdown fish, denoting which systems, stages, molecular functions and biological processes have phenotype annotations.
        Clicking on a shaded box in the ribbon view will open a table to view more detailed phenotype annotations. Associated figures are displayed when available.
