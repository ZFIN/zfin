    Sequence Targeting Reagents

    <p>Sequence Targeting Reagents are used to decrease the amount of gene product either transiently for Morpholinos  or in a more permanent manner for TALENs and CRISPRs.</p>
    <p>
    Information including target sequences comes from either published works or community databases <a href="https://zfin.org/ZDB-PUB-151007-9">(Burgess, et al.)</a>
    ZFIN verifies reagent sequence data when we add them to the database.
    However, we recommend that you conduct independent sequence analysis using your specific strain before ordering any reagent.
    </p>
    <p>
    Morpholino data has been curated since 2004, CRISPR and TALEN data since 2013.
