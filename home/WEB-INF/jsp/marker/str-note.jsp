    Sequence Targeting Reagents
</div>
<div class="popup-body">
    Sequence Targeting Reagents are used to decrease the amount of gene product either transiently for Morpholinos  or in a more permanent manner for TALENs and CRISPRs.
    Information including target sequences comes from either published works or community databases <a href="https://zfin.org/ZDB-PUB-151007-9">(Burgess, et al.)</a>
    ZFIN verifies reagent sequence data when we add them to the database.
    However, we recommend that you conduct independent sequence analysis using your specific strain before ordering any reagent.  Morpholino data has been curated since 2004, CRISPR and TALEN data since 2013.
