    Mutants/alleles are reported using their line designation. For each mutant/allele, the type of mutation, the localization of this mutation within the gene,
    the consequence of this mutation on the transcript, and the mutagen used to create the allele are reported when known.
    The mutant information comes from multiple sources including expert curation of the published literature, as well as bulk submission from groups such as Sanger.
