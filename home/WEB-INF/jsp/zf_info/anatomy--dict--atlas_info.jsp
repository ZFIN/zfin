<div><h3><b>Zebrafish anatomical atlases - general information</b></h3>
<p>Currently there is an <a href="/zf_info/anatomy.html">atlas</a> for four developmental 
  stages (24h, 48h, 72h and 128h). There is also a <a href="../../../zf_info/zfbook/stages/stages.html">developmental 
  staging series</a> which includes photos and anatomical descriptions of developmental 
  stages from egg through 72h. An atlas of the <a href="/cgi-bin_kirby/ZFIN_jump?record=ZDB-PUB-961014-1280">adult 
  nervous system</a> is available in hardcopy. </p>
<p> A small consortium of laboratories is working to establish a <a href="meeting_sum.html">dictionary</a> 
  of zebrafish anatomical terms that can be used to annotate images, descriptions 
  of mutant phenotypes, gene expression patterns, etc. </p>
