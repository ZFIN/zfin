<h2>ZEBRAFISH STOCK CENTER PLANNED</h2>
<font size="-1">By. W. Driever, MGH East 4, 13th Street, Bldg. 149, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA</font><p>

	Following on the heels of discussion at the Cold Spring Harbor meeting, a committee has begun contacting various funding agencies who may be able to support a zebrafish stock center in North America.  Currently, groups from Boston and Eugene are working with both the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health.</p><p>

	Based the results of the survey which was conducted during the meeting, this group is compiling statistics about the need for and potential use of a stock center.  If you did not attend the meeting or did not have a chance to fill out this survey, please do so now.  A form is included with this issue of the <i>Monitor</i>.</p><p>

	It will also be extremely important for success of the funding applications to receive letters of support from you.  Please take a moment to write a short note to Wolfgang Driever.  State your view on the importance of establishing a centralized stock center that can maintain a collection of mutant and wild-type zebrafish and that can distribute these fish to the scientific community.</p><p>

	The committee would also like to hear from anyone else who is interested in planning the stock center or who may also be thinking about establishing a stock center so that efforts can be coordinated for highest efficiency and for best meeting the needs of the community.</p><p>

Please address your letters to:</p><p>
