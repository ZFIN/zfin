<b>HIGH SCHOOL INSTRUCTION RESOURCE LIST</b>
<p>
 By P. Edwards
</p><p>
 	There has been an increasing amount of interest in using the zebrafish as a model in the study of vertebrate development and genetics in high school and elementary school classes and labs.  I have begun to assemble a list of those who are interested in planning such a curriculum and those who are willing to act as resources.  The list can also be used by the participants as a means to network with each other.  If you would like to be included on the list and have not already done so, please contact Pat Edwards, ZF Publications Coordinator, Institute of Neuroscience, 1254 University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403-1254 USA; phone (503) 346-4556; FAX (503) 346-4548; e-mail address: <a href="mailto:edwards@uoneuro.uoregon.edu"> edwards@uoneuro.uoregon.edu</a>.   Be sure to include your full mailing address, phone & FAX numbers, and e-  mail address.
