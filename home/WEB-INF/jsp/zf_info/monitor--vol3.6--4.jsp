	Zebrafish trunk neural crest cells that migrate at different times have different fates:
early-migrating crest cells produce dorsal root ganglion neurons as well as glia and pigment
cells, while late-migrating crest cells produce only non-neuronal derivatives.  When presumptive
early-migrating crest cells were individually transplanted into hosts such that they migrated late,
they retained the ability to generate neurons.  In contrast, late-migrating crest cells transplanted
under the same conditions never generated neurons.  These results suggest that, prior to
migration, neural crest cells have intrinsic biases in the types of derivatives they will produce. 
Transplantation of presumptive early-migrating crest cells does not result in production of dorsal
root ganglion neurons under all conditions, suggesting that these cells require appropriate
environmental factors to express these intrinsic biases.  When early-migrating crest cells are
ablated, late-migrating crest cells gain the ability to produce neurons, even when they migrate on
their normal schedule.    Interactions among neural crest cells may thus regulate the types of
derivatives neural crest cells produce, by establishing or maintaining intrinsic differences
between individual cells.</p><p>
