<div><h2>GENTLE FIXATION BY FREEZE SUBSTITUTION GIVES
EXCELLENT HISTOLOGICAL RESULTS WITH ZEBRAFISH EMBRYOS</h2>

	Freeze substitution is a previously described technique for the gentle
fixation and dehydration of tissue.  I originally employed it solely because it
was reputed to result in minimal loss of antigenicity and had been used by
other groups with similar research interests (Shiurba <i>et al</i>, 1991;
Michael <i>et al</i>, 1984). However, I wish to draw it to the attention of
other zebrafish workers because it gives such excellent histological results
with zebrafish embryos which are far superior to other methods, such as
paraformaldehyde fixation for example (fig 1).</p><p>
	The main features of the technique are as follows.  By freezing the tissue at
a temperature well below the eutectic point (-85C; the minimum
temperature at which ice crystallization occurs), rapid and uniform ice
formation occurs and tissue damage due to crystal formation is eliminated, so
long as the tissue sample is small and the cryogen volume is large.  The
cryogen recommended here, isopentane, has high specific heat and thermal
conductivity, so that heat from the sample is conducted away fast and does not
adversely affect the temperature of the cryogen.  After freezing, the tissue is
transferred to methanol kept cold on dry ice. The methanol slowly dissolves
(substitutes) the ice from the tissue, but has very little fixative activity
because fixation is indirectly proportional to the ambient temperature.</p><p>
	Freeze substitution is, therefore, a convenient method for generating high
quality histological material without the use of cross-linking fixatives and
with only minimal denaturation.  Since it is compatible with the use of wax
sectioning, it is also more convenient than cryo-fixation.  It might also be
the method of choice for the dehydration and embedding of previously fixed
embryos, e.g. sectioning of whole-mounts or prior to sectioning for <i>in
situ</i> hybridization or immunostaining.</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>Method</b></p><p>
</p><p>
	1.  Place 100 ml of isopentane in a small Duran bottle into an ice box or
wide-mouthed thermos filled with dry ice.  When the temperature is equilibrated
(1-2 hours), pour ~200 mls of liquid nitrogen directly over the bottle.  It is
best to monitor the temperature of the isopentane with a thermo-couple, but a
rule of thumb is to wait 10-15 min after pouring the nitrogen before freezing
the tissue.  It is a good idea to swirl the isopentane periodically to equalize
the temperature.  In a separate ice bucket, place as many 5-10 ml labeled vials
of methanol as required on dry ice.  (Screw-top scintillation vials are ideal;
flip-top lids are very difficult to remove when cold.)
</p><p>
	2.  Pipette embryos (in their chorions) on to one end of a 5x1 cm piece of
nylon gauze (or other suitable material).  Dab off excess water through the
underside of the gauze; the embryos will adhere quite strongly to the gauze
through surface tension.  Embryos can also be dechorionated and embedded in
agarose (e.g. 0.8% low-melting point agarose for support; excess agarose should be trimmed with a scalpel prior to freezing.</p><p>
	3.  Hold the gauze by the other end with forceps and plunge the embryos into
the center of the isopentane for 1 min.
</p><p>
	4.  Transfer the embryos (now securely frozen onto the gauze) to the methanol.
Store at -70C (at least), preferably colder, for 5 days or
longer<b>*</b>.  I have not tried shorter times.
</p><p>
	5.  When required, slowly warm the tissue by transferring it to
-20C (freezer) for 2-3 hrs, the fridge for 2-3 hrs, and to room
temperature for 2-3 hrs.
</p><p>
	6.  The embryos are ready for embedding.  I routinely use polyester wax (BDH)
because this is molten at 37C and is gentler on the tissue.  It is
also soluble in methanol or ethanol, avoiding the need for additional organic
reagents.  This wax can conveniently be cut in a cool room
(<20C).
</p><p>
	The one drawback of this method seems to be the short shelf life of the
tissue.  I have stored tissue in the fridge for 2 months and found a
considerable increase in non-specific nuclear staining (looks similar to
toluidine blue counterstaining) and a decrease in signal.  However, the results
are sufficiently good to offset this minor complaint.
</p><p>
<b>*</b> At -70C ice crystals will be able to form, but this does
not seem to be a problem here, perhaps because zebrafish embryos dehydrate
sufficiently before crystals form.  However, should material of higher quality
be required, e.g. for EM work, then it is recommended to use 15% propylene
glycol as a cryoprotectant during the freezing, and to freeze substitute in
ethanol at -100C throughout.  This is a slightly more complicated
procedure but does not require expensive equipment; the temperature is attained
using a slurry of dry ice and nitrogen kept in a thermos in the freezer with
periodic monitoring and addition of more dry ice and nitrogen as required.
Consult Campbell <i>et al</i> (1991) for a description of the technique.

brownish and refractile after equilibration in glycerol and under Nomarski
optics.  The numerous brown intracellular spots are HRP staining products.
