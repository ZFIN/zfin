<h2>EXPRESSION DOMAINS OF A ZEBRAFISH HOMOLOGUE OF THE <i>DROSOPHILA</i> PAIR-RULE GENE <i>HAIRY</i> CORRESPOND TO PRIMORDIA OF ALTERNATING SOMITES</h2>

<i>her1</i> is a zebrafish cDNA encoding a bHLH protein with all features characteristic of members of the<i> Drosophila </i><i>hairy-E</i>(<i>spl</i>) family. During late gastrulation stages, <i>her1</i> is expressed in the epibolic margin and in two distinct transverse bands of hypoblastic cells behind the epibolic front. After completion of epiboly, this pattern persists essentially unchanged through postgastrulation stages; the marginal domain is incorporated in the tail bud and, depending on the time point, either two or three paired bands of expressing cells are present within the paraxial presomitic mesoderm separated by regions devoid of transcripts. Labeling of cells within the <i>her1</i> expression domains with fluorescein-dextran shows that the cells in the epibolic margin and the tail bud are not allocated to particular somites. However, allocation of cells to somites occurs between the marginal expression domain and the first expression band, anterior to it. Moreover, the <i>her1</i> bands and the intervening non-expressing zones, each represents the primordium of a somite. This expression pattern is highly reminiscent of that of <i>Drosophila</i> pair-rule genes. A possible participation of <i>her1</i> in functions related to somite formation is discussed. </p><p>
