<b>ZEBRAFISH YAC LIBRARY?</b>
<p>

</p><p>
	I have contacted a company who may be willing to make a zebrafish YAC library, but they want to obtain some feeling for the level of interest in the zebrafish
community.  While a number of my  colleagues have encouraged me to pursue the
creation of YAC library, I have not done an extensive survey of the zebrafish
scientific community. If you are interested in having a zebrafish YAC library
available for your current or future research, I would greatly appreciate it if
you would send me a brief note or e-mail message stating that you are
interested in it.  This same company is also interested in making cDNA and
genomic libraries from puffer fish DNA.  If you are interested in any of these
libraries, I would be happy to forward the company's name and address to you
once they have built the libraries.

	While they will probably proceed with the puffer fish libraries within a few
weeks, they haven't decided about the YAC library and I would greatly
appreciate your support in convincing them that the zebrafish community is
really interested.  If there is any other information that you would like me to
pass on to this company, I would be happy to relate whatever you send me.
