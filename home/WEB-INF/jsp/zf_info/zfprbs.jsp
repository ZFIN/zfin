<p> <b>BAC libraries:</b>
</p><p>Two BAC libraries are currently available that have been constructed from 
  <a href="/ZDB-FISH-990623-3">Tu strain</a> DNA,
  the same DNA currently be used for the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/">Sanger 
  Center genome sequencing project</a>. 
</p><ul>
<li><b>CHORI<a name="CHORI"></a>-211 BAC library</b>: 
    The CHORI-211 BAC library was constructed by Chung 
    Li Shu and Kazutoyo Osoegawa in Pieter J. de Jong&#8217;s 
    laboratory at Children's Hospital Oakland Research 
    Institute. Genomic DNA was isolated from testis 
    of 6 males by Dr. Gerd-Joerg Rauch and partially 
    digested with a combination of EcoRI and EcoRI Methylase. 
    Size selected DNA was cloned into the pTARBAC2.1 
    vector between the EcoRI sites. The ligation products 
    were transformed into DH10B electro-competent cells 
    (BRL Life Technologies). The library has been arrayed 
    into 384-well microtiter dishes and also gridded 
    onto 6 22x22cm nylon high-density filters for screening 
    by probe hybridization. Each hybridization membrane 
    represents over 18,000 distinct zebrafish BAC clones, 
    stamped in duplicate. Library construction was supported 
    by sub-contracts from a grant awarded to <a href="/cgi-bin/ZFIN_jump?record=ZDB-PERS-971205-2">Robert 
    Geisler</a> at The Max-Planck-Institut f&#252;r Entwicklungsbiologie, 
    T&#252;bingen. For more information check: <a href="http://www.chori.org/bacpac/home.htm">http://www.chori.org/bacpac/home.htm</a></li>

<li><b>Daniokey<a name="Daniokey"></a> BAC library:</b> 
    The Daniokey BAC library, created by the <a href="/cgi-bin/ZFIN_jump?record=ZDB-PERS-980903-2">Ronald 
    Plasterk</a> Laboratory and Keygene N.V., is available 
    via the <a href="http://www.rzpd.de/">RZPD</a> in 
    Berlin. The library is available as glycerol stocks, 
    filters, and PCR pools. It, too, was constructed 
    from <a href="/cgi-bin/ZFIN_jump?record=ZDB-FISH-990623-3">Tu 
    strain</a> genomic DNA. A partial HindIII digest 
    resulted in 104,064 BAC clones with an average insert 
    size of ~175 kb. The library provides approximately 
    10x coverage of the zebrafish genome. <br>

<p><b>PAC library:</b>
</p><ul>
<li> <b>BUSM1<a name="BUSM1"></a> PAC library</b>. The <a href="http://vmresearch.org/amemiya/cta/ZF-PACS.pdf">BUSM1 
    PAC library</a> was constructed by <a href="/cgi-bin/ZFIN_jump?record=ZDB-PERS-960805-28">Chris 
    Amemiya</a> while he was at Boston University School of Medicine. The library 
    was constructed using MboI partial digests of high molecular weight DNA from 
    blood cells of ~ 200 individuals (<a href="/cgi-bin/ZFIN_jump?record=ZDB-FISH-960809-7">AB 
    strain</a>) ligated to the BamHI sites of pCYPAC6 (GenBank AF133437). The 
    library is archived in 271 384-well dishes. High-density filters and PCR-screenable 
    pools for this library are available from the <a href="http://www.rzpd.de/">RZPD</a>. In 
    addition to the RZPD, numerous other labs have replicas of this library, including: 
    Will Talbot, Steve Johnson, John Postlethwait, Len Zon, Marnie Halpern, Shuo 
    Lin, and Didier Stanier. Copies of the library also exist in Japan and Europe. 
    Special requests for pools for PCR screening and/or high density filters 
    can be made to Chris Amemiya (<a href="mailto:camemiya@vmresearch.org">camemiya@vmresearch.org</a>).

<p><b>YAC<a name="YAC"></a> library:</b>
</p><ul>
<li>
    The <a href="http://www.resgen.com/products/ZFISHYAC.php3">Zebrafish YAC 
    Library</a>, constructed by the Massachusetts General Hospital in collaboration 
    with the MIT Center for Genome Research, is available from <a href="/cgi-bin/ZFIN_jump?record=ZDB-COMPANY-980622-14">Research 
    Genetics</a>. The average insert size for the library is 480 kb. With approximately 
    19,000 clones, the library represents five zebrafish genome equivalents. Inserts 
    were cloned into the EcoRI site of the pRML1 and pRML2 vector arms. J57D was 
    used as the yeast host strain. Ref: T.P. Zhong, K. Kaphingst, U.Akella, M.
