<div><h2>DIFFERENTIATION WAVES</h2>
<p>
Dear Colleague:</p><p>

I am finishing a book about the intersection of three major fields of
biology:
</p><p>
Gordon, R. (1995). The Hierarchical Genome and Differentiation Waves:
Novel Unification of Development, Genetics, and Evolution  (Singapore:
World Scientific), in prep.
</p><p>
If your work might be relevant to this review, I would appreciate reprints
or preprints as soon as possible, or an update, if I've been in contact
with you previously.
</p><p>
If you are curious, condensed accounts are given in:
</p><p>
Gordon, R. (1993). The fractal physics of biological evolution. In:
Beysens, D., N. Boccara & G. Forgacs, eds. Dynamical Phenomena at
Interfaces, Surfaces and Membranes. Commack, N.Y.: NOVA Science
Publishers, 99-111.
</p><p>
Gordon, R., N. K. Bjorklund & P. D. Nieuwkoop (1994). Dialogue on
embryonic induction and differentiation waves. Int. Rev. Cytol. 150,
373-420.
</p><p>
Bjorklund, N.K. & R. Gordon (1994). Surface contraction and expansion
waves correlated with differentiation in axolotl embryos. I. Prolegomenon
and differentiation during invagination through the blastopore, as shown
by the fate map. Computers & Chemistry,  in press.

Thanks for your help.

Best regards, -Dick Gordon
