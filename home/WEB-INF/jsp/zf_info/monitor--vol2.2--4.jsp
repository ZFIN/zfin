<div><b>NEW PROTOCOLS FOR RAISING BABIES</b><p>

<b>Spawning Zebrafish in a Net Bottom Bucket</b></p><p>
	Zebrafish can be spawned in containers that have had their bottoms cut out and
replaced with 1/4" or 1/8" black plastic netting (Vexar works well).  We use
2.5 gallon plastic buckets suspended in clean temperature-controlled 10 gallon
aquaria.  </p><p>
	The eggs drop through the net to the bottom of the aquarium.  Because there
are no marbles, the eggs are easy to remove.  The adults stay isolated from the
eggs so they are also easy to remove. We have used a second bucket (with a
solid bottom) around the net bottom bucket to harvest eggs.  </p><p>
	The eggs are then incubated in a plastic 750 ml bucket which has had the
bottom removed and replaced with a 250 um nitex screen.  Incubation containers
are suspended in an aquarium with a heater and an active biofilter.  The same
container is used through the larval stage until fish are large enough to
transfer out of the aquarium and be weaned onto flake food.</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>Zebrafish Larvae Don't Need Live Food: </b></p><p>
<b>Rearing Larvae on Commercial Diets</b></p><p>
	If you hate culturing paramecia for the first feeding of zebrafish larvae, why
not use an artificial diet?  We have had excellent results rearing zebrafish
larvae entirely on a yeast-based diet made by Provesta Corp. of Bartlesville,
OK.  Their diet, called "Microfeast", is intended to be fed to <i>Artemia</i>
and rotifers, but it works well on zebrafish larvae, too.</p><p>
	Artificial diets are messier than live diets, so we culture the zebrafish
larvae in plastic 750 ml buckets which have had the bottoms removed and
replaced with a 250 um nitex screen.  A hot glue gun does a good job of
attaching the screen to the bottom of the bucket.  These buckets are then
suspended in a heated 20 gallon aquarium with a well-aged biological filter.
The diets are fed by an automatic feeder ("The Fish Sitter", available at large
aquarium stores) that has been modified to feed continually through the
daylight hours.</p><p>
	It is important not to overfeed larvae.  The feeder will hold a lot more feed
than is necessary. About 0.1 g/day is enough to feed 200-300 larvae in a 750 ml
bucket.  Daily maintenance takes about 15 minutes and consists of refilling the
feeder and flushing the bucket with clean water to remove uneaten food and
feces.</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>Marvelous Meaty <i>Artemia</i> Cookies</b></p><p>
	Instead of hatching fresh <i>Artemia</i> for your broodstock and juvenile
zebrafish every day, your might consider making <i>Artemia</i> cookies and
feeding these instead.  First, hatch a big batch (about two weeks' worth) of
<i>Artemia</i>.  </p><p>
	After hatching, clean the shrimp in the normal way, rinse with fresh water,
and then concentrate on a 100 um screen.  (We use a 3" PVC connector with a
Nitex screen sandwiched between the fitting and a short length of 3" pipe.)  </p><p>
	Pipette the normal ration of <i>Artemia </i>for a tank into the well of an ice
cube tray (plastic ones that make small cubes are best).  Repeat until you run
out of <i>Artemia</i> or tray space.  Add fresh fish water to fill the trays
and freeze.  </p><p>
	When it is time to feed the fish, just pop out a cookie (ice cube) and add to
the tank.  The ice will slowly melt and release the <i>Artemia</i>, feeding
your fish.  You can do the same thing with any fresh material such as worms,
fruit flies, or liver paste.
