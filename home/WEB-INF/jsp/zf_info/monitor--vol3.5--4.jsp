	In the Max-Planck-Institut f&#252;r Entwicklungsbiologie in T&#252;bingen, we are running a large fish facility with about 7000 individual fish containers. Before planning the fish house, we tested many protocols, aquarium types, and procedures over a period of several years. The house HAS now run for three years, during which a very large number of embryonic mutants were identified and are being kept. Although we use a large facility (located in a separate building) that operates on the principles we describe here, we would like to emphasize that small versions of this system, where everything is located in a single room, have been built as well and run successfully in several other laboratories. The principles of the system have been described briefly (Mullins et al., 1994).

<b>AQUARIA</b>: In our lab, mainly concerned with mutant screens, we need a large number of rather small fish containers. These aquaria are interconnected and the water from one room with many (200-1500) aquaria is collected and recycled through one common filter per room. From the filter basin it is pumped up into a large reservoir located above the racks of aquaria in the fish room (Figure 1). From there it is distributed by gravity to the aquaria. The flow rate can be adjusted for each row of aquaria, which gives normally an exchange of 3 tank volumes per hour. In our fish house, the filters are in the basement, while in a second, small facility they lie underneath one of the racks of tanks, in the same room with the aquaria. The two different types of aquaria we use are described below (Figure 2). 
<hr>
<b>Figure 2</b><br>
<img src="fig2.jpg">
<hr>
<b>A. Overflow system</b> (Figure 2a): Half-sized mouse cages (2.5 l) or other
plastic containers are used with a hole with a grid (or a slit) that functions
as an overflow. The water is supplied to these containers (7-12 on a shelf) via
an overlying pipe with a series of outlets (silicone tubes with cut off
eppendorf pipette tips, to ensure even water flow) through which the water
squirts. The outlets are spaced such that each container can be supplied with
running water (Figure 2a). The water comes from a reservoir at the top of the
room, runs into each container, and exits through the overflow and onto the
rimmed shelf. Three different mesh sizes (0.3 mm, 1 mm, 2 mm), depending on the
age of the fish, are used to keep fish from escaping through the overflow. At
one end of the shelf is a pipe extending below the shelf, where the water is
collected, drained into the filter, and recycled as described above. The system
holds all sizes of containers, and is therefore very versatile. One can also
take out the containers and replace them in different order, or carry them away
for setting up matings. We use half- or full-sized mouse cages, rat cages and
small 1 liter containers for single fish and pairs of fish in this system.
<p>
Recently we have begun to use a hybrid 'serial overflow' (SO) system for
keeping small numbers of fish at higher density. In the SO system, mouse cages
or rat cages are further subdivided by partitionings as in the serial tank
system, with slits on the bottom to allow the dirt to be carried away. SO
systems stay cleaner, and seem to work well for smaller numbers of fish. This
type of vessels also allows more efficient use of space; for instance, when
males and females of the same genotype need to be separated, they can still
reside in the same mouse cage (and they even get to see one another). 
</p><p>
<b>B. Serial tank system</b> (Figure 2b): Aquaria of the dimension of about
1.20 m length, 60 cm wide and 22 cm high are subdivided by glass partitionings
that leave a 1.5 mm slit at the bottom, to give a series of 8-10 interconnected
compartments of about 12 liters each. Water flows into the aquarium at one end,
runs through the slits, and carries the dirt with it. The water is collected at
the other end by an overflow (with a cover grid to keep fish from escaping)
which determines the water level. From there, water is drained into a big
filter unit; clean water is then pumped up into a reservoir from which it gets
distributed again, just by gravity. 
</p><p>
<b>Fish densities:</b> Maximum densities are about 10 adult fish per liter of
water in the serial tank system. We can raise fish to adulthood (3 month) at
densities of up to 40 fish per liter in the overflow system. Usually, we
transfer them into tanks after about 2 months when they are big enough not to
pass through the slits anymore. The fish seem to do better at higher densities,
probably because the tanks are cleaner because the water is kept in constant
movement and the dirt is carried out via the overflows and the slits. Fish tend
to be aggressive at low densities, so we add some plastic grass to give them a
chance to hide.
</p><p>
<b>Illumination:</b> We use a 14h light-10h dark cycle. For convenience, we
have lamps above every row of serial tanks; however, a sufficiently bright
illumination of the room would probably suffice. The overflow systems do not
have their own illumination. 
</p><p>
<b>Biological filters: </b>We recycle the water through biological filters of
appropriate sizes (1000 liters of water per m<sup>2</sup> of foamed plastic of
10-30 ppi). The water runs by gravity through the filter and then into basins
from which it is pumped up into reservoirs that are located above the aquaria
in the fish rooms. There are two pumps per filter that run on alternate 12 h
cycles; in case one breaks down, the other takes over automatically. The
filters provide a large surface area for aerobic bacteria which degrade
ammonium compounds to nitrite and finally nitrate. While the former compounds
are very toxic to the fish, the nitrate is not. Since the surface area of the
filters must be large, we use mats of foamed plastic, through which the water
is dribbling into the basin, arranged in a series of shelves with increasing
density of foam. The top layer is disposable synthetic filter material which
collects the coarse debris; it is checked twice a week for clogging and
replaced if necessary. The filter mats are cleaned twice a year in a washing
machine. The production of nitrate leads to lower pH. The pH in the fish water
is between 6.5 and 7.5, although higher and lower pH may work also. We measure
the pH, nitrate and nitrite (using Merck sticks) in the filter basins twice a
week. Normally 5% of the water is exchanged with fresh water daily; this is
done using a timer. If the pH drops and/or the nitrate increase is rapid
(caused by intense feeding), more fresh water is added. In addition, there is a
device in the filter basin (a float like in toilets) that causes automatic
refilling with fresh water in case the water level drops, because of a leak or
after removal of water from the system in fish rooms (eg, for setting up
crosses).
</p><p>
<b>Water: </b>T&#252;bingen tap water is hard (approx. 500uS), very rich in
CaCO3, and has a pH of 8 or higher. The composition of the tap water is as
follows:</p><p>
</p><pre>
Cations              mg/l       Anions                     mg/l       
Calcium              73.3       Hydrogencarbonate          195        
Magnesium            13.2       Chloride                   17         
Sodium               11.5       Sulfate                    72         
Potassium            2.2        Nitrate                    9.7        
Iron                 <0.01      Nitrite                    <0.01      
Manganese            <0.01      Phosphate                  0.09       
Ammonium             <0.01                                             </pre>
<p>
We use a mixture of tap water and reverse osmosis water, at a conductivity of
about 350 uS at pH 7.5. This seems to be a good compromise between sufficiently
low conductivity to stimulate egg laying and a high enough carbonate buffering
capacity at an acceptable pH. All water is filtered through charcoal before
going into the systems. 
</p><p>
<b>Temperature:</b> The temperature of the water is adjusted to 26C
with a number of heaters placed into the filter basin. The temperature in the
fish rooms is slightly higher (27C) to prevent condensation of
water on the walls of the rooms. Higher temperatures are uncomfortable for the
researchers, they might also reduce the life span of the fish. As we have
several heaters for each basin, none of which is sufficient to heat up above
tolerable values, there is no danger of overheating. Temperatures dropping to
room temperature by failure of the heaters is not dangerous for the fish.</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>Snails:</b> We also have snails (Florida fresh water snails, <i>Planorbella
spec.</i>) in our tanks. They clean the walls of algae and eat the surplus
food, which has a very positive effect on the water quality. Adult snails are
sometimes killed, and baby snails can be eaten by the adult fish, so it is
necessary to regularly resupply snails. Snails multiply in the aquaria in which
fish are raised. Usually some have to be removed at regular intervals. Even
though snails introduce a small amount of extra work, they are very helpful; a
tank without snails is easily spotted because the fish are hidden behind
growing algae. </p><p>
<b><i>Problems with the aquaria</i></b>: Clogging of the outlets, grids and
slits. Snails or little pieces of dirt sometimes get into the outlets and may
clog them. We check daily to ensure that the water is clean and running in all
aquaria because fish kept at high density may die overnight if the water is not
running. The containers in the overflow system stay clean only if there are
enough fish to sufficiently stir the water such that the dirt is carried out of
the overflow. With only a few adult fish and careless feeding, they may get
very dirty and may need to be cleaned regularly (about once every 4 weeks).
Running the water at higher rates helps, but there is a limit because the
reservoirs may run dry, and the incident of clogging is higher with higher flow
rates. In the serial tanks, dirt collects in compartments with no or few fish.
The last compartment, from which the dirt has to exit via the overflow should
therefore hold many fish (or be cleaned regularly). 
</p><p>
<b><i>Problems with the water</i>:</b> T&#252;bingen tap water is too hard for
good egg laying, so it has to be diluted with desalted water. On the other
hand, due to its high carbonate content, it has good buffering capacity and
usually the pH is stable. If the filters do not work or if their capacity is
too low, the pH may rise to values above 8, preventing growth of the nitrifying
bacteria in the filter. With too much feeding, this may lead to bacterial
growth (turbidity) of the water. We had this problem at the beginning. Frequent
water changes and adjusting the pH by mixing the tap water with reverse osmosis
water at a ratio of about 1:1 will reduce this problem. In the beginning, we
did not use mixed water and our charcoal filter had too low a capacity, which
caused frequent and erratic death of baby fish. Strangely enough, the adult
fish survived these difficult times remarkably well and even laid eggs. 
</p><p>
<b><i>Diseases:</i></b> As many tanks share a common filter, there is the
problem that diseases introduced into one tank may spread very quickly through
the entire system. The intensive fish work carried out in our fish house (about
2,000 crosses set up weekly with fish from different aquaria and rooms, up to
200 containers of baby fish started weekly for raising) makes it very difficult
to keep individual systems or rooms isolated. It would be orders of magnitude
more work, and much more costly. Unlike in the case of mice and humans, fish
germs do not spread via the air, so the possibilities of infection are
restricted to food, water, or fish introduced from the outside. We do not use
food from natural fresh water ponds. The tap water is chlorinated and goes
through charcoal. We do not introduce fish from the outside without putting
them into quarantine first and treating them with medicines against parasitic
infections. We collect eggs from them in the quarantine room, treat the eggs
with Clorox (see <i>The Zebrafish Book</i> for a protocol), and transfer the
babies into the fish facilities. 
</p><p>
Although we did not start our facility with a disease free population of fish, we did not have any problems with diseases for about four years. We had noticed an occasional skinny fish before, but since
less than about 1/1000 of the fish were affected at any time, there was no
reason for concern. In the past summer, we started observing significant
numbers of sick fish, they got skinny, stopped eating and died eventually. We
found that almost all were infected with nematodes (capillaria) and a few in
addition with fish tuberculosis (Tb). We do not know where these diseases came
from, and whether they were the primary cause of the sickness, but we assume
that they were present in our population all along. The problem was more severe
in the rooms where many containers held only a few old fish which had not been
kept very clean. This probably led to a spreading of the infection, because the
nematodes propagate via eggs passed through fish feces, that are taken up by
other fish if left around. We did a round of serious cleaning of the tanks,
filters and mouse cages, treated the fish with Levamisol, twice within two
weeks (which was supposed to be effective against the worms, but not the Tb).
The fish were mostly o.k. after this, although we did not get rid of all the
worms. Now we try to remove all infected fish as soon as we detect them, and
further, we try to keep the fish containers rather clean to avoid spreading the
diseases via the feces of infected fish. An effective treatment to get rid of
the worms was published here recently by the Driever lab, which we intend to
use to solve this problem. 
</p><p>
We have also had a serious spread of fish
tuberculosis, Tb. Because there seems to be no effective treatment against Tb,
we are currently starting individual rooms from sterilized eggs (see <i>The
Zebrafish Book</i> for a protocol) after disinfecting, hoping that this will
solve the problem. It will of course be ideal if the facility can be maintained
disease-free in this way. According to our fish veterinarian, both diseases
often occur latently in fish populations without harming them, but they can
become a problem, when the fish are subjected to some form of stress. During
the time we had disease problems, the fish were most certainly subjected to a
significant amount of stress, as we kept setting them up frequently for crosses
during our screen. Overall, therefore, our impression is that a good genetic
background achieved by frequent outcrossing, healthy food, and clean conditions
suppresses the level of these infections to a tolerable level. 
</p><p>
<b>Food: </b>Adult fish are fed with live, frozen or dry food. We use fresh
<i>Drosophila </i>larvae, frozen <i>Bosmina</i> (a small freshwater crab which
can be bought here), green flakes, red flakes, and brine shrimp nauplia, for
fish older than 6 weeks. Food, including dry food, is suspended in water in
squirt bottles, and squirted through small holes in the lids of the tanks.
Larval fish and fish for ready for mating are fed 3 times, adults twice, and
adults that are not being used once daily. Baby fish are fed with salt water
rotifers or paramecia during the first week of feeding, and later with brine
shrimp <i>nauplia</i>. 
</p><p>
<b><i>Comments:</i></b> We believe that a variety of different food is good for
fish health. It is clear that dry food alone is inadequate to keep fish in good
laying condition. Our fish like <i>Drosophila</i> larvae more than anything
else, but growing them in large scale for fish food is no trivial task. We do
not know for certain, but we suspect that the fly larvae supply the fish with
essential vitamins or fatty acids they otherwise do not get in large enough
quantities. Alternatively, we feed frozen <i>Bosmina</i> that are harvested
seasonally from fish-free ponds at sugar factories; but the supply of
<i>Bosmina</i> is limited. <i>Artemia nauplia</i> hatched from dry eggs are
liked as well, but they are very small. Furthermore, if unhatched artemia eggs
are present in the food, the fish may get seriously constipated. We cannot get
live adult <i>artemia</i> here. Baby food always was and is the biggest
problem. We tried dry baby food several times but found it quite
unsatisfactory. <i>Paramecia</i> grown according to the protocol of the Driever
lab are fine, but sometimes the cultures become contaminated (this may be a
problem particular to laboratories also working with flies), together with
being expensive and work intensive. For a long time we had a supply of frozen
dormant rotifers, which are harvested seasonally from the ponds in sugar
factories mentioned above. They hatch within 24h in fresh water and are
concentrated by very low speed centrifugation. The supply, however, is limited,
and presently we do not have them. A good alternative are salt water rotifers,
although this requires raising the babies for some time in salt water to allow
the rotifers to survive. <i>Drosophila</i> larvae and rotifers have the added
advantage that they can be stored at 4C for two (<i>Drosophila</i>
larvae) to 7 days (rotifers) before feeding, so they can be prepared in
advance. A protocol for growing salt water rotifers is given below.</p><p>
<b>Raising fish: </b>For egg collection, we place males and females into mating
chambers (Figure 3) the preceding afternoon: A plastic box with the bottom
replaced by a mesh of stainless steel (2 mm), inserted snugly into an outer box
such that there is a space between the mesh net and the bottom of the outer
box. We use one liter boxes for single pair matings. Plastic green grass is
placed into the inner box. Five such mating chambers are held on one plastic
tray, covered with a lid or with another tray (with mating boxes) (Figure 3).
The water is fish water from the reservoirs. Depending on the condition of the
fish, an average of 50% of single pair matings lay eggs the morning after being
set up, and another 100% on the following morning. For cleanliness of the eggs,
the fish are not fed on the day they are set up. They may stay in the boxes
without food and water changes for two days. The shortest interval for setting
up fish for mating is about one week for females, and three days for males, if
the fish are to be used frequently.
</p><hr>
<b>Figure 3</b><br>
<img src="fig3.jpg">
<hr>
	The eggs when laid fall through the steel net and are collected from the outer
box with a plastic tea sieve and placed into E3 saline (5mM NaCl, 0.17 mM KCl,
0.33 mM CaCl2, 0.33 mM MgSO4, 10<sup>-5</sup>% Methylene blue). We collect the good eggs and place them in petri dishes within 12 h after laying, up to 100
per 94 mm dish, or 40 per 60 mm dish in E3 medium. The water is changed once on
the third day of development.
<p>
Swimming larvae (day 5) are placed into fish water (from the reservoir) at a
density of 70 fish per mouse cage in about 1 liter. When salt water rotifers
(which is what we usually feed now) are fed during the first week, the water is
supplemented with sea salt to a concentration of 3g/l such that the rotifers
survive for at least several hours. We put the babies directly into mouse cages
and place the cages onto the shelves in the overflow system without connecting
them to the running water. With clean paramecia or rotifers, the water does not
need to be changed in the first week, otherwise it has to be replaced every
other day or so. Babies are fed twice a day, such that there is always some
food around. The overflow is provided with a 0.3 mm mesh sieve to prevent the
babies from being flushed out. At day 14, when the baby fish are big enough to
eat brine shrimp, we start feeding brine shrimp <i>nauplia</i>, and one snail
is added per pot. We feed initially small, but increasing amounts of
<i>artemia</i> two to three times a day, and let the water dribble through. On
day 21, the fine mesh sieve is replaced with a 1 mm sieve and the flow rate is
increased to slow running, and another three weeks later they are switched to
the 2 mm sieve. The fish can get adult food when they are 6 weeks old or so,
and can be put into tanks shortly thereafter. They may already give eggs when
they are two months old, but the fecundity is optimal after 4 months or so.</p><p>
<b><i>Problems</i></b>: For babies, the right amount of food is crucial for
their survival and vigor. Heavy overfeeding with rotifers may lead to high
nitrite levels, underfeeding causes unequal growth rates among the population.
Overfeeding with <i>artemia</i> is dangerous, as rotting <i>artemia</i> spoil
the water. A good rule of thumb is that the <i>artemia</i> should be mostly
eaten after about 20 minutes, at which point the babies will have nice red
bellies. If properly done, all 70 fish placed into a container at day five will
grow up in these containers until adulthood. If space allows, baby fish can be
raised at lower densities, which makes them grow even faster.
</p><p>
<b>Maintenance:</b> for 6 rooms, 5 filters with a total of about 7,000
containers holding between 1 and 100 fish ( about 300,000 fish), we have 5 full
time people for cleaning the rooms and the plastic boxes, checking and cleaning
the tanks, preparing the food, and feeding the adult fish. In addition, the
scientific staff, the technicians and seasonal students participate in the tank
checks once daily, the growing of baby food and <i>artemia</i>, and feeding of
the individual fish and the baby fish. Control of outlets, grids, and overflows
or slits from each container is done twice a day, this takes about twice two
hours for one person for all 7,000 containers, plus two hours daily cleaning of
slits and overflows. Every half year or so each system is cleaned thoroughly,
the pipes are flushed, and the filter mats are cleaned. The coarse filters are
checked daily. 5% of the water is exchanged daily, and the water measurements
are made twice a week.
</p><p>
<b>Safety:</b> The systems, aquaria, shelves, filters, plumbing etc. were built
by an experienced firm from high quality material (glass, valves, pipes) using
a special technique for gluing the glass, rendering the aquaria extremely
stable for a long time. For the aquaria, we have glass where ever possible,
because it is easy to keep clean and transparent. The firm is not particularly
cheap, on the other hand the great safety, stability and ease in maintenance is
worth it, we believe, and, once installed, it is a very good investment. So far
we have had no catastrophe such as breaking of a tank or a pipe coming loose
overnight. The design allows untrained people to grasp very quickly how it
works and easily take care of things. This is, we feel, of very great
importance. The system is designed so the containers cannot run dry, nor can it
be overheated. The worst possible catastrophe would be if both pumps of one
filter unit would break down simultaneously. This would cause suffocation of
the highly populated tanks, but the individual aquaria would not run dry.
During the three years, we had a couple of pump breakdowns, but never both
pumps in one room. There are alarm systems for pumps, temperature, water level
in the reservoirs above the tanks, water level in the millipore water
reservoir, and the ventilation of the rooms. These alarms are important for us
because so many people use our facility. For smaller facilities, we believe
that regular inspections and checks would be quite sufficient; an alarm system
for the water level in the reservoirs above the tanks would probably provide
adequate security.
</p><p>
<b>Salt water rotifers.</b> The following brief description is a modification
of a protocol that was kindly provided to us by Drs. P. Dhert and P. Sorgeloos,
University of Ghent, Belgium. A more detailed protocol is available upon
request. We grow <i>Brachionus spec</i>. rotifers in 50 liter round plastic
tanks with 15 g/l seasalt in deionized water at about 25C, with
slow-bubbling aeration. Rotifers are inoculated at a density of 100-150 R/ml
and are fed on instant Culture Selco food (CS, Inve Aquaculture, Baasrode,
Belgium). Depending on the density of the culture, we feed increasing amounts
of CS: 6 g at set up, and 6, 7, 8.5, 10, 11, 12 g on subsequent days. After 7
days, the culture has more than 500 R/ml and is harvested through a fine net,
and the rotifers are resuspended in 14 liters of seawater (15 g/l sea salt), of
which about a quarter is used to reinoculate a new culture. The remainder can
be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week and is used for feeding the
babies (2x12 ml per mouse cage per day).
