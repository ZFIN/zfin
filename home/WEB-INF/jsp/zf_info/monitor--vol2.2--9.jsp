	We have recently modified a LiCl RNA extraction protocol (Auffray and Rougeon, <i>Eur. J. Biochem.</i> <b>107</b>:303-314, 1980), to suite our needs in RNA extraction from ZF embryos. With the protocol described below we have routinely obtained approximately 10 micrograms/ 60 ZF embryos. The procedure is simple and convenient, as all steps are carried out in microfuge tubes. </p><p>

1.	Collect about 60 ZF embryos in sterile microfuge tube and remove as much
liquid as possible. </p><p>

2.	Add 0.8 ml Sol. I (3 M LiCl, 6 M UREA, 0.1% SDS, 10 mM NaAc pH 5.5, 200 U/ml Heparin) and homogenize the embryos using a syringe and a 21 g needle 10 times.  Keep on ice for at least 16 hrs (in the cold room). </p><p>

3.	Spin in microfuge for 15 min. at 4 C, resuspend pellet in 1 ml Sol. II (4 M
LiCl, 8 M Urea) and spin again. Repeat step 3. </p><p>

4.	Resuspend pellet in 0.2 ml Sol. III (0.1 M NaAc pH 5.5, 0.1% SDS), extract
twice with an equal volume of phenol:chloroform (1:1), and once with
chloroform. Precipitate with 70% ethanol and 0.3 M NaAc. </p><p>

5.	Resuspend the RNA pellet in water and determine the OD. We have used this
RNA directly for Northern analysis.
