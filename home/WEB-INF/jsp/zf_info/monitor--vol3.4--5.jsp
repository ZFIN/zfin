<b><i>ZEBRAFISH BOOKS</i> TEMPORARILY OUT OF PRINT
BUT, UPDATE PACKETS ARE STILL AVAILABLE</b>
<p>
 By P. Edwards
</p><p>
 	We have temporarily run out of copies of <i>The Zebrafish Book</i>.  Another printing will be done in late spring 1995, when the <i>Developmental Dynamics</i> zebrafish staging series (Kimmel, et al. 1995) is available to include in the new edition.  We hope that this does not cause a hardship to those needing it.  In the meantime, the information in <i>The Zebrafish Book</i>, as well as other zebrafish information, can be accessed on the World Wide Web ()
</p><p>
 	If your 1993 version of <i>The Zebrafish Book</i> has not been updated to the 1994 Edition 2.1 version, please contact Pat Edwards, ZF Publications Coordinator, Institute of Neuroscience, 1254 University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403-1254 USA; phone (503) 346-4556; FAX (503) 346-4548; e-mail address: <a href="mailto:edwards@uoneuro.uoregon.edu"> edwards@uoneuro.uoregon.edu</a>.  I will be glad to see that an update packet is sent to you for each 1993 book you have.
