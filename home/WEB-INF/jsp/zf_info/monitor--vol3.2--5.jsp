To facilitate molecular genetic analysis of vertebrate development, haploid genetics was used to construct a recombination map for <i>Danio (Brachydanio) rerio</i>.  The map consists of 401 random amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs) and 13 simple sequence repeats spaced at an average interval of 5.8 cM. Novel strategies exploiting the advantages of haploid genetics and RAPD markers were developed which quickly map lethal and visible mutations and which place cloned genes on the map. The map is useful for position-based cloning of  mutant genes, the characterization of chromosome rearrangements, and the investigation of evolution in vertebrate genomes.
