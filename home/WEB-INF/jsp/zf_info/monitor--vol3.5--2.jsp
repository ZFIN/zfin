(<i>Nature</i> <b>375</b>:678-681, 1995) </p><p><i>Hox</i> genes are essential for growth and patterning of the tetrapod limb skeleton. Mice mutant for the <i>Hoxd-13</i> gene have an important delay in morphogenesis owing to reduced proliferation. Based on the appearance of atavisms in such mice, we suggested that modifications of <i>Hox</i> gene regulation may have been a source of morphological variation during the evolution of tetrapod limbs. Pectoral and pelvic fins are homologous to fore- and hind-limbs, respectively. To compare the relative importance of <i>Ho</i> genes during fin versus limb morphogenesis, we cloned zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) HoxD and HoxA complex genes and analyzed their expression during fin development. The results suggest a scheme for the fin-limb transition in which the distal autopods (digits) are neomorphic structures produced by unequal proliferation of the posterior part of an ancestral appendix. </p><hr> <b>Zebrafish Science Monitor Vol 3(5)</b><br> <a href="cont.html">Return to Contents</a>
