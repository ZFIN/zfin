<h3>To prepare 24 h Embryos:</h3>

1.	Dechorionate 24 h embryos.
<p>
2.	Transfer into 10-2 M (4 mg/ml) freshly made colchicine.
</p><p>
3.	Incubate at 28.5C for 90 min in the dark.
</p><p>
4.	At room temperature (~21&#8226;C), rinse the embryos and transfer embryos into 1.1% NaCitrate.  Puncture the yolk and start a timer.
</p><p>
5.	Dissect away the yolk.
</p><p>
6.	At 8 min, transfer the dish to ice for an additional 8 min.
</p><p>
7.	Transfer the embryos with as little citrate as possible into a 3:1 mixture of methanol:acetic acid.
</p><p>
8.	Let stand 20 min and change the methanol acetic solution.  Store in freezer overnight.

</p><h3>To prepare 24 h spreads:</h3>

1.	Pick up an embryo with forceps.
<p>
2.	Blot it until partially dry.
</p><p>
3.	Transfer the embryo into a watch glass containing 3 drops of 50% acetic acid and mince with forceps 1 min.
</p><p>
4.	Triturate the suspended cells two times in a 50 ul wiretrol microcapillary.
</p><p>
5.	Drop droplets of the cell suspension onto a slide, prewarmed to 50C, and quickly pull the liquid back up into the wiretrol.  Drop ~6 droplets per slide.
</p><p>
6.	Expel the remaining liquid in the wiretrol onto the watchglass, mix and drop onto another slide, etc. for about 4 or 5 slides per embryo. This procedure will gradually dilute the cells yielding a range of cell densities on the slides.
</p><p>
7.	Leave slides at 50C for about 10 min to completely dry.
</p><p>
8.	Stain in Giemsa for 30 min:
</p><dir>
		Giemsa:
<dir>
<br>			4 mls Giemsa Stock (Sigma Diagnostics)
<br>				4 mls 0.5 M Na Phosphate pH7
<br>				200 mls distilled water
</dir></dir>
9.	Rinse twice with dH2O.

<h3>To prepare blastulae:</h3>

1.	At 60-100 min after fertilization, remove the chorions with pronase:
<dir>
<li>		Drain eggs; add 5 ml of 0.5 mg/ml pronase for 3.5 min
</li><li>		Dilute eggs with 200 ml of 8x water.  Rinse three times more with 200 ml washes of 8x water.
</li><li>			8x water = 12 ml stock salts per liter dH2O
</li><li>			Stock salts = 40 g Instant Ocean per liter dH2O
</li></dir>
2.	Transfer the embryos into 3.5 cm petri dishes at a density of 25 per dish in 8x water.
<p>
3.	Break the yolks by lifting the embryos to the surface on a sharp probe. This will produce a ball of cells.
</p><p>
4.	At 120 min after fertilization, transfer the cells to 1.1% Na citrate at RT for 10 min.
</p><p>
5.	Fix in 3:1 methanol:acetic acid for 60 min and then change to fresh 3:1.
</p><p>
6.	Store in freezer.

</p><h3>To prepare blastulae spreads:</h3>

1.	Transfer the blastulae in 3:1 onto an ice cold slide.
<p>
2.	Tease apart with fine needles or forceps.
</p><p>
3.	Add small droplets of 50% acetic acid and flame the slide three times over a Bunsen burner.
</p><p>
4.	Transfer the slide to a 50C slide warmer.
</p><p>
5.	Stain with Giemsa for 30 min (see above).
