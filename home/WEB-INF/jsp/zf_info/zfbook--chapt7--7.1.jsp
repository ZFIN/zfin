<h1>CHAPTER 7 - GENETIC METHODS</h1>
<h2>Conventions for Naming Zebrafish Genes</h2>
<i>(Source: M. Mullins)</i>
<br>Genetic designations vary immensely from organism to organism, and the zebrafish community recognizes the
    importance of agreeing upon conventions for naming mutants and genes. The following conventions have been chosen
    by most labs to minimize confusion and maximize the utility of the nomenclature and the ease with which people
    outside (as well as those within) the field can follow the field. It is very important that the entire zebrafish
    community adopt one set of conventions. A <a href="http://wiki.zfin.org/display/general/ZFIN+Zebrafish+Nomenclature+Conventions">summary of current nomenclature
    guidelines</a> is available on <a href="/">ZFIN</a>.
    <p>
</p><h3>Naming genes identified by mutation</h3>
    1. The name of a gene identified by mutation should refer to the ostensible phenotype of the mutant without any
    inherent interpretation of the phenotype. It should not be too specific. Determining the molecular mechanism by
    which a phenotype is produced can be a formidable task and should not be inferred by the name of the gene. The
    name should be a mnemonic for the mutant phenotype. For example, <i>cyclops</i> is an excellent name for the
    mutation isolated in Eugene that produces a cyclopic phenotype.
    <p>2. The name should be unique, one or two words, and italicized. Longer names tend to be impractical to use.
        Avoid choosing names identical to those used in other species.

    </p><p>3. For mutations in different genes that all have similar phenotypes, a single name followed by consecutive
        numbers should not be used. This nomenclature makes the field less accessible to the outsider. A mutation in
        a second gene resulting in cyclopia could be called <i>fused-eyes</i>, but should not be called
        <i>cyclops2</i>.

    </p><p>
</p><h3>Naming cloned genes</h3>
    1. For nonhomologous "novel" genes identified by cloning, the conventions above apply with the exception of the
    use of numbers. For a new gene family, it would be appropriate to name the individual genes in the family with a
    single family name followed by consecutive numbers. The numbers would immediately follow the name with no hyphen
    or space between them. No further letters would follow this number in the gene name. For example, <i>abc1</i>,
    <i>abc2</i>, <i>abc3</i> are appropriate; however, <i>abc1A</i>, <i>abc1B</i>, and <i>abc1C</i> are
    inappropriate.
    <p>2. For homologous genes cloned (rather than those with just some sequence similarity which are probably not
        true homologues), the same name as in the counterpart organism should be given to the zebrafish gene. This
        would make it easier to follow "homologue" work in different organisms. The fish gene should not be preceded
        with "Z" or "Zf", otherwise there will be thousands of zebrafish genes beginning with "Z....". For example,
        a zebrafish homologue to the mouse <i>Wnt1</i> gene becomes the zebrafish <i>wnt1</i> gene.

    </p><p>
</p><h3>Abbreviated name</h3>
    A gene identified either by mutation or molecular analysis should be abbreviated by three lower case italicized
    letters or by three lower case letters and a number (no hyphen) italicized. All letters should be roman, i.e. no
    greek letters. The letters should be unique with respect to other named zebrafish mutants and genes and should
    be letters derived from the full name. For example, the abbreviated name for <i>cyclops</i> is <i>cyc</i>.
    Numbers should generally not be used in naming a gene identified only by mutation. When a number is included in
    the name (see Naming cloned genes, above), there should be no hyphen or space between the letters and the
    number. Genes identfied as homologues to human or mouse genes should use the same abbreviation, if possible, and
    thus are not limited to 3 letters.
    <p>
</p><h3>Alleles</h3>
    The allele-specific designation should be denoted by a superscript. Dominant mutations will be designated by "d"
    in the first position of the superscript. All allele names without a "d" then indicate a recessive allele. The
    next position of the superscript (this will be the first position if the mutation is recessive) will be a lower
    case letter that designates the laboratory in which the mutation was isolated. This laboratory letter is then
    followed by unique numbers and/or letter(s) for the particular allele which completes the allele designation.
    Because "d" will denote "dominant", "d" cannot be used for a laboratory designation. Each allele designation
    from a given laboratory is unique. Because each laboratory has a different letter designation, all mutant
    alleles from all zebrafish laboratories are unique and can be accessed easily by computer. ZFIN maintains a <a href="/zf_info/zfbook/lab_desig.html">list of laboratory allele designations</a>. You can contact <a href="mailto:zfinadmn@zfin.org">ZFIN</a> to obtain an allele designation.
    <p>
        For example, in Eugene all allele names begin with "b" and are numbered sequentially, approximately in the
        order they were recovered. <i>cyc<sup>b16</sup></i> is an allele of <i>cyclops</i> that was isolated in
        Eugene (b). <i>b16</i> is a unique allele designation in Eugene. No other mutant allele in Eugene or
        elsewhere will have this allele designation whether it be <i>cyclops</i>, <i>spadetail</i>, <i>golden</i>,
        etc.

    </p><p>
</p><h3>Priority in names</h3>
    1. When mutations in the same gene are found independently in more than one laboratory and given different
    names, then the name that appears first in the literature will be given priority. Sometimes different mutant
    alleles of the same gene can have very different phenotypes and it may take a while before it is shown that the
    mutations are in the same gene. The first published name would get priority and all other alleles would adopt
    this designation.
    <p>2. When a mutation is found in a previously cloned zebrafish gene (which has been published), then the mutant
        will take the cloned gene's name. For example, in Monte Westerfield's laboratory a mutation was induced in
        the <i>msxb</i> gene. The mutation in the gene is also be referred to as <i>msxb</i> (in this case,
        <i>Dfmsxb</i>,
        because the mutation is a deficiency).

    </p><p>3. If both the cloned gene and the mutation already exist with different names and at some later point they
        are found to be the same gene, then the name of the mutation takes priority even if the cloned gene was
        named first. In this case the unique name of the mutation would probably be more relevant to the function of
        the gene than the cloned gene's name, and this unique mutant name would be easier to remember than the gene
        name. If in the example above, a mutant named <i>braindead</i> (<i>bdd</i>) had been characterized, and it
        was later discovered to be a mutation in the <i>msxb</i> gene, then the <i>msxb</i> gene would now be
        designated <i>bdd</i>.

    </p><p> With these conventions, some changes have already been made in mutant designations. Two previously
        identified recessive pigmentation mutants <i>golden1</i> and <i>golden2</i> contain mutations in two
        different genes. Charline Walker and Chuck Kimmel decided to change the name of <i>golden2</i> to
        <i>brass</i> (<i>brs</i>) and <i>golden1</i> to just <i>golden</i> (<i>gol</i>). This should avoid any
        future confusion about <i>golden2</i> being a second allele of <i>golden</i>.

    </p><p>
</p><h3>An unsettled issue</h3>
    In the case of zebrafish homologues where the nomenclature in the counterpart organism is contrary to our
    nomenclature, there is still no convention. The two schools of thought can be illustrated through the naming of
    the zebrafish homologue to the mouse <i>Brachyury</i> gene, abbreviated as <i>T</i>.
    <p> One nomenclature puts the importance of a common nomenclature between organisms above that of the
        nomenclature within zebrafish. In this case the zebrafish homologue of the mouse <i>T</i> gene would also be
        named <i>T</i> in zebrafish. As discussed above, it would be against our conventions to capitalize the gene
        name and to use only one letter, however, since in mouse the abbreviated name is capitalized we would now
        capitalize the name in zebrafish.

    </p><p> A second nomenclature puts the importance of the zebrafish nomenclature above that of a nomenclature common
        among organisms. In this case, the zebrafish homologue to the mouse <i>Brachyury</i> or <i>T</i> gene could
        be named <i>brachyury</i> and abbreviated in zebrafish as <i>bry</i> to follow our nomenclature. This
        example is further complicated because the zebrafish homologue of the <i>Brachyury</i> mutant has been shown
        to be <i>no tail</i> (<i>ntl</i>). The zebrafish convention would be to call this mutant <i>no tail</i>
        whereas as the other convention would rename it <i>brachyuria</i>.
