<b>POSITION TO RUN ZEBRAFISH AND XENOPUS FACILITIES</b>
<p>
	A veterinary technician- level position is open at the University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, to maintain a zebrafish facility (an approximately 500
tank system, designed and installed by Marine Biotech), and a <i>Xenopus</i>
colony (approximately 9 large tanks housing about 1000 frogs), used by the
research groups of R. Moon and D. Kimelman. Prior experience with zebrafish is
an asset, though the primary requirements are a high level of dedication, and a
reasonable expectation to remain in this position for several years.  Once
employed, the person will take courses to be certified as a veterinary
technician.  Interested individuals should contact Dr. Randall Moon (206- 543-1722)
for further details, or submit applications, including telephone numbers for
references, to:
