	We have examined the origin of cardiac progenitors in the zebrafish embryo by
injection of single blastomeres with a lineage tracer dye, and examined the
formation of the zebrafish heart tube by serial sectioning of immunostained
embryos.  At the 512-cell stage (early blastula), most cardiac progenitors lie
in a marginal zone that extends from 90 degrees longitude (midway between
the future dorsal and ventral axis) through 180 degrees longitude (the
future ventral axis) to 270 degrees longitude.  By focusing on myocardial
progenitors located at 90 degrees (and 270 degrees) longitude, we found
that a single cell injected in the early blastula can contribute progeny to
both the atrium and ventricle.  A cell injected in the midblastula contributes
progeny to either the atrium or ventricle, but not both.  This analysis
suggests that, at least for these myocardial progenitors, the atrial and
ventricular lineages separate in the midblastula.</p><p>
	Precardiac cells involute early during gastrulation and turn towards the
animal pole with other early involuting cells.  These cardiogenic cells reach
the embryonic axis around the 8-somite stage, and there they coalesce to form a
pair of myocardial tubular primordia on either side of the midline.  By the
21-somite stage, the tropomyosin-immunoreactive myocardial tubes have moved
closer to each other, and a distinct group of cells the endocardial progenitor
cells, sits medially between them.  The myocardial tubes then fuse to enclose
the endocardial cells and form the definitive heart tube.  By 22 hours
postfertilization (26-somite stage), the heart tube is clearly beating.  The
regionalization of cardiac myosin heavy chain expression distinguishes the
cardiac chambers at this stage, although they are not morphologically
delineated until 36 hours.</p><p>
	This work shows that cardiogenic regions can be identified in the early
blastula, and that chamber restriction seems to arise in the midblastula.
Additionally, it provides the basis for embryological perturbation at the
single cell level, as well as for the genetic analysis of heart tube formation
in the zebrafish.</p><p>
