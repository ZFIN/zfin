<h2>OCT Embedding for Cryostat Sectioning of Embryos or Larvae</h2> (Source: R.BreMiller)<p>

1. Fix animals as desired.</p><p>

2.Wash in fix buffer, 3 times for 5 min each wash.</p><p>

3.Soak fixed fish in 30% sucrose until they sink.</p><p>

4.Transfer fish to embedding chamber (plastic test tube stoppers or inverted Beem capsules whose tips have been cut off) filled with OCT cryostat embedding medium (Tissue Tek).</p><p>

5.Freeze chamber by dipping it slowly and gradually into liquid N2.</p><p>

6.Frozen blocks can be stored at -70C if they are wrapped well so that the tissue does not dehydrate.</p><p>

7.Cut 10-20  &#181;m sections on a cryostat at -20C, transfer them to subbed slides and let them dry completely.</p><p>

8.Sections can be stored at -20C in a sealed slide box.
