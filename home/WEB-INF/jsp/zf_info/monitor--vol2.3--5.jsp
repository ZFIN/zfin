<div><h2>AUTONOMOUS EXPRESSION OF THE <i>NIC1</i> ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR MUTATION IN ZEBRAFISH MUSCLE CELLS</h2><p>
By D.S. Sepich, R.K. Ho, and M. Westerfield</p><p>
</p><p>
	The <i>nic1</i><sup>b107</sup> (<i>nic1</i>) mutation blocks expression of
both functional and clustered acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in zebrafish
muscle.  Normally, signaling between motoneurons and muscles regulates AChR
clustering.  To learn if signaling is affected and to identify the primary
cellular target of the <i>nic1</i> mutation, we made mosaic embryos by
transplanting motoneurons and muscle precursors from wild-type to mutant
embryos.  Genotypically mutant muscles cells fail to cluster AChRs even when
contacted by wild-type motoneurons, whereas genotypically mutant motoneurons
induce AChR clustering on wild-type muscle cells. Moreover, mutant muscle cells
fail to cluster AChRs under culture conditions that induce AChR clustering on
wild-type cells.  We conclude that the <i>nic1</i> mutation acts autonomously
in muscle cells rather than by affecting signaling between motoneurons and
muscle.  The wild-type <i>nic1</i> gene is necessary in muscle for expression
and clustering of AChRs.</p><p>
