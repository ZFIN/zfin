<p>
1.	Fix in fresh BT fixative (see page  ) overnight at 4C.
</p><p>
2.	Wash three times in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at RT.
</p><p>
3.	Wash once with dH2O for 5 min at room temp.
</p><p>
4.	Immerse in acetone for 7 min at -20C.  (Cool acetone ahead of time).
</p><p>
5.	Wash once with dH2O for 5 min, RT.
</p><p>
6.	Wash once with 0.1 M phosphate buffer at RT

7.	Wash three times in 1% DMSO, 0.1% Triton  in PBS. 

8.	If working with fish that have blood cells, quench blood cell activity:
</p><dir>
	a.	Rinse in dH2O, 5 min.
<br>	b.	Soak in 0.3% H2O2 in absolute methanol for 30 min. 
<br>	c.	Rinse three times in 1% DMSO, 0.1%Triton, in PBS.
</dir>
9.	Incubate with ABC (avidin-biotin HRP complex, Vectastain Kit: Vector Laboratories, Inc.) in 1% DMSO, 0.1% Triton in PBS for 2 hr at RT.  (You should make this up by mixing solutions A and B from the kit at least 30 min before using.)<p>
<b>ABC Solution (Avidin-Biotin HRP complex):</b>
</p><dir>
<li>			3 ml 1% DMSO, 0.1% Triton, PBS
</li><li>			30 ul Vectostain solution A
</li><li>			30 ul Vectostain solution B
</li></dir>

10.	Wash with 1% DMSO in PBS three times for 15, 30, and 45 min each.
<p>
11.	Presoak for 15 min in DAB presoak solution (see page  ).
</p><p>
12.	Add 5 ul 3% H2O2.		
</p><p>	
13.	Monitor the reaction which should be complete within 10-20 min.  Do not over stain.
</p><p>
14.	Wash three times with 0.1 M PO4 Buffer.
</p><p>
15.	Wash once with dH2O.
</p><p>
16.	Dehydrate with an ethanol series (50%, 70%, 85%, 95%, twice 100%, 5 min each).
</p><p>
17.	Clear with methyl salicylate.
</p><p>
18.	Mount with Permount between bridged coverslips.
