	We would like to announce a new WWW archive site called FishScope. FishScope contains a set of MPEG and QuickTime time- lapse movies dealing with zebrafish development. These recordings illustrate the cellular mechanics involved in zebrafish gastrulation and neurulation. These time- lapse recordings were made using a scanning laser confocal microscope. FishScope also contains a still image gallery of confocal images of zebrafish embryos stained with fluorescent vital dyes. </p><p>
The address of FishScope is: 
<a href="http://depts.washington.edu/fishscop/">

</p><p>
	Additional time- lapse recordings of zebrafish and medaka embryos will be added in the near future.
</p><p>
	We welcome any feedback and comments about this site.
