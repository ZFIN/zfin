    <h2>About ZebraShare</h2>
    zebraShare is intended to help establish fruitful collaborations by sharing mutant fish lines, and information about
    these mutants, particularly when authors do not otherwise see a clear path to publication.
    </p>
    More specifically, zebraShare is a intended to help researchers form collaborations that put carefully constructed
    mutant lines to good use, augmenting sharing resources available through other services (i.e. ZIRC). zebraShare is
    intended for researchers that wish to advertise and share high quality mutants that laboratories are not currently
    pursuing such as those having no observed phenotype. Contribution via zebraShare does not constitute a publication,
    and labs of origination maintain full rights to the lines they generate. For instance, after listing fish on
    zebraShare labs may decide to pursue these lines again. If fish lines are shared through zebraShare there is an
    explicit expectation that collaborating labs will discuss appropriate authorship if research culminates in
    presentations or publications.
    </p>

    To promote sharing of high quality lines, we ask that users only contribute lines with a confirmed lesion, carried
    to at minimum the F2 generation. This is not, for instance, a database for sharing tested CRISPRs. Other resources
    are already available for this (e.g. CRISPRz).
    </p>

    Why do we invite data about wild-type looking fish? First, we invite data about a-phenotypic mutants to avoid
    unnecessary duplication of efforts. Second, we think this data is important because it can reveal information about
    a gene's requirements. Finally, understanding which single genes seem dispensable can help researchers hone in on
    the genes or gene-combinations which are most important to pattern tissues.

    <h2>How to make your submission to zebraShare</h2>
    Download the <a href="/zf_info/zebraShareSubmission.xlxs">zebraShare Submission Workbook</a> and fill out all the details for your alleles (use the
    Allele tab).

    </p>
    Once you have the Submission Workbook complete and ready to submit, log into ZFIN and go to the
    <a href="new">Submission Form</a>.
    Fill out the Submission form. Specify the authors, title, and abstract for this submission, and specify your name,
    e-mail, and who is authorized to edit the alleles. Submit the form, which will create a ZFIN submission record. You
    can attach the zebraShare Submission Workbook and any additional image files to your submission record.

    </p>
    ZFIN curators will process this submission as part of their high priority literature curation workflow. You may be
    contacted if the curators have questions during the processing of your submission. Once complete, an allele record
    will be created for each allele submitted. The line submitter and others they specify will then be able to add/edit
    some of the details associated with their alleles.
