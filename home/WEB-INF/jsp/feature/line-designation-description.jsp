<h1 align="center">Line Designations</h1>

<p>Each institution that produces fish lines should acquire an
institutional line designation.  Historically, line designations were
assigned to labs, but the proliferation of labs producing fish has
resulted in a change to assigning the designations on an institutional
basis. All labs producing fish lines at the same institution should seek to share a single institutional line designation.</p>

<p>Allele-specific names for zebrafish mutants are denoted by superscript following the mutant locus symbol. They are formed by the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dominant mutations are indicated by a <i>d</i> in the first position; a name without a <i>d</i> indicates a recessive allele.<br> <br>

  <li>The superscript contains a lower-case letter designation corresponding to the institution at which the mutation was isolated (see table below). This will occur either at the beginning of the name (if recessive) or immediately after the <i>d</i> (if dominant).</li> <em>Please note that "d" cannot be used as a institution line designation.</em><br><br>

 <li>The institution identifer is followed by a unique number for the particular line.<br><br>

 <li>Additional letters should not immediately follow the institution designation but may be appended to the number at the end of the name.<br><br>

<li>Only alphanumeric characters should be used in the line designation.<br><br>

 <li>Each allele number must be unique. Because each institution has a different letter designation, all lines are uniquely identified.  Click on a designation below to see a list of all lines currently associated with that institution.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, in Eugene, Oregon, all allele names begin with <i>b</i> and are
  numbered sequentially, approximately in the order that they were identified;
  <i>cyc<sup>b16</sup></i> is an allele of <i>cyclops</i> that was isolated in
  Eugene.</p>

<p>More examples:<br>
 Dominant allele from Carnegie Institute - <i>chi<sup>dc124</sup></i><br>
 Recessive alleles from Children's Hospital, Boston - <i>dly<sup>cz3321</sup></i>,  <i>egy<sup>cz5</sup></i><br>
 Recessive allele from University of Pennsylvania, with appended letters - <i>bbp<sup>p58cd</sup></i></p>
