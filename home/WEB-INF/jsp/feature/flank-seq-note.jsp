   Flanking Sequence (genomic)

<div class="popup-body">

    The wild-type reference sequence and the variant sequence are shown in red, flanked by sequences 500 bp upstream and 500 bp downstream of the variant, in the following format:
<p>
    500 bp upstream sequence
    <br>
    Reference/Variant (in red)
    <br>
    500 bp downstream sequence
<p>
    All displayed sequences are on the forward (plus) genomic strand of the Ensembl genomic build specified in the "Location" section of the feature page.
    <br>
    Genomic coordinates of variants are curated from publications by ZFIN curators, or submitted directly to ZFIN by collaborators.
    <br>
    For variants that have been mapped to the latest genomic build, ZFIN retrieves the 500 bp upstream and downstream flanking sequences based on the curated/submitted coordinates.
