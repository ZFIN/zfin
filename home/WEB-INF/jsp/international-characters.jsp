    Searching for names with non-English characters
</div>
<div class='popup-body'>
    <p>
        Many ZFIN author names include non-English characters (umlauts, accents, etc.).
        Currently, the ZFIN search mechanism does not recognize full spellings that do
        not include these characters (i.e. to search out publications by Uwe Str&auml;hle, you
        must use the umlauted &auml; in the name; ZFIN will not find spellings of  strahle or straehle).
        If you fail to find a name that should be listed in ZFIN,  try the following alternate searches:
    <ul>
        <li> in publication searches, search for a co-author name instead
        <li> in people searches, use the person's first name
        <li> search with a portion of the name (i.e. hle)
        <li> use the proper character in your search (i.e. N&uacute;&ntilde;ez, N&uuml;sslein-Volhard, Str&auml;hle, etc.)
    </ul>
    <p>
        If all else fails, contact <a href="mailto:zfinadmn@zfin.org">Jonathan Knight</a> for help with your search.
