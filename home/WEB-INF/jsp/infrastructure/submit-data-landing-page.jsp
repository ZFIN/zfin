        <h1>Submitting Data to ZFIN</h1>

        <p>
            Data in ZFIN are primarily manually curated from peer-reviewed publications or through data exchanges and
            submissions from other databases. With the increased production of research data, ZFIN aims to provide the
            zebrafish research community with support for direct submission of data sets that cannot be easily represented
            in publications. A detailed description of the process for direct submission of data is presented in
            <a href="/ZDB-PUB-160725-13">Howe et al. Methods in Cell Biology Vol. 135, 2016, pg 483-508</a>. In addition,
            the templates including the necessary set of information for each data type are made available
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p7e6LyxU1wSObD4q8Fon0f6Kf5w-O_xPF-QTmDZSwJc/edit#gid=2099777656">here</a>.

            <p>
                <a href="/action/zebrashare">ZebraShare</a> is intended to help establish fruitful collaborations by sharing
                mutant fish lines, and information about these mutants, particularly when authors do not otherwise see a
                clear path to publication.

                The anatomical ontology is a list of structures, organized hierarchically into an ontology, with
                descriptions of each structure.
