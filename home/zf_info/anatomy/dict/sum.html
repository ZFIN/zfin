<b><i>
<p>Overview</p>
</i></b>
<p>Development of a complete and uniform anatomical atlas and dictionary for
  the zebrafish is vital to the success of zebrafish science. Specifically, the
  dictionary is necessary for:</p>
<ul>
  <li><u>Effective data dissemination and informatics.</u> Reference to anatomical
    structures is central to all phenotypic description. For example, in situ
    expression patterns are described in terms of the structures in which expression
    is observed; mutations are described in terms of the anatomical structures
    that are affected. In this way, anatomical structure is the common ground
    on which expressed genotype meets mutational phenotype, yielding powerful
    insight into gene function. A concise and consistent anatomical atlas is
    necessary to support this correlation, particularly in an automated or computer-aided
    fashion.</li>
  <li><u>A reference framework.</u> By defining what anatomical structures exist,
    the dictionary establishes an ontological framework for a variety of reference
    resources, including a concise staging series (i.e., defined by development
    of structures, not time), an atlas of reference images indexed by anatomical
    structure and developmental age, annotated 3-D reconstructions and time lapse
    movies.</li>
  <li><u>Interoperability</u>. A stable, concise anatomical atlas is the key
    to leveraging work done in other species, particularly through semi-automated
    mapping between zebrafish data (stored in ZFIN) and data stored in other
    species&#146; databases (e.g. MGI,Flybase). Given dictionaries for two species,
    mapping relationships between analogous structures (e.g. fins in fish=legs
    in flies) can be developed; searches based on mutations affecting zebrafish
    fins could yield genes expressed in <i>Drosophila</i> legs. </li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>Current status</i></b></p>
<p>The current version of the zebrafish anatomical dictionary is being written
  by a <a href="mem.html">consortium of researchers</a>, each serving as an expert
  for a particular set of anatomical structures. The dictionary includes a list
  of structures, organized as an anatomical and developmental hierarchy, with
  descriptions and illustrations of each structure. </p>
<p>Currently there is an <a href="/zf_info/anatomy/dev_atlas.html">atlas</a> for
  four developmental stages (24h, 48h, 72h and 128h). There is also a <a href="../../../zf_info/zfbook/stages/index.html">developmental
  staging series</a> which includes photos and anatomical descriptions of developmental
  stages from egg through 72h. An atlas of the <a href="/<!--|CGI_BIN_DIR_NAME|-->/ZFIN_jump?record=ZDB-PUB-961014-1280">adult
  nervous system</a> is available in hardcopy. </p>
