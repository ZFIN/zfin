<p>The anatomical ontology is a list of structures, organized hierarchically into an ontology, with descriptions of each structure. The current version of the zebrafish anatomical ontology is being written by a <a href="http://zfin.org/zf_info/anatomy/dict/mem.html">consortium of researchers</a>, each serving as an expert for a particular set of anatomical structures. Additional anatomical information derived from the current literature is provided by the ZFIN curation group.

Development of a complete and uniform anatomical ontology for the zebrafish is vital to the success of zebrafish science.  The anatomical ontology is necessary for: 

 <p>   * Effective data dissemination and informatics. Reference to anatomical structures is central to all phenotypic description. For example, in situ expression patterns are described in terms of the structures in which expression is observed; mutations are described in terms of the anatomical structures that are affected. In this way, anatomical structure is the common ground on which expressed genotype meets mutational phenotype, yielding powerful insight into gene function. A concise and consistent anatomical ontology is necessary to support this correlation, particularly in an automated or computer-aided fashion.

 <p>   * A reference framework. By defining what anatomical structures exist, the ontology establishes a framework for a variety of reference resources, including a concise staging series (i.e., defined by development of structures, not time), an atlas of reference images indexed by anatomical structure and developmental age, annotated 3-D reconstructions and time lapse movies.

  <p>  * Interoperability. A stable, concise anatomical atlas is the key to leveraging work done in other species, particularly through semi-automated mapping between zebrafish data (stored in ZFIN) and data stored in other species' databases (e.g. MGI,Flybase). Given dictionaries for two species, mapping relationships between analogous structures (e.g. fins in fish=legs in flies) can be developed; searches based on mutations affecting zebrafish fins could yield genes expressed in Drosophila legs.</p>
