<p>Development of a complete and uniform anatomical dictionary for the zebrafish 
  is vital to the success of zebrafish science. Specifically, the dictionary is 
  necessary for:</p>
<ul>
  <li><u>Effective data dissemination and informatics.</u> Reference to anatomical 
    structures is central to all phenotypic description. For example, in situ 
    expression patterns are described in terms of the structures in which expression 
    is observed; mutations are described in terms of the anatomical structures 
    that are affected. In this way, anatomical structure is the common ground 
    on which expressed genotype meets mutational phenotype, yielding powerful 
    insight into gene function. A concise and consistent anatomical atlas is necessary 
    to support this correlation, particularly in an automated or computer-aided 
    fashion.</li>
  <li><u>A reference framework.</u> By defining what anatomical structures exist, 
    the dictionary establishes an ontological framework for a variety of reference 
    resources, including a concise staging series (i.e., defined by development 
    of structures, not time), an atlas of reference images indexed by anatomical 
    structure and developmental age, annotated 3-D reconstructions and time lapse 
    movies.</li>
  <li><u>Interoperability</u>. A stable, concise anatomical atlas is the key to 
    leveraging work done in other species, particularly through semi-automated 
    mapping between zebrafish data (stored in ZFIN) and data stored in other species&#146; 
    databases (e.g. MGI,Flybase). Given dictionaries for two species, mapping 
    relationships between analogous structures (e.g. fins in fish=legs in flies) 
    can be developed; searches based on mutations affecting zebrafish fins could 
    yield genes expressed in <i>Drosophila</i> legs. </li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>Current status</i></b></p>
<p>The current version of the zebrafish anatomical dictionary is being written 
  by a <a href="mem.html">consortium of researchers</a>, each serving as an expert 
  for a particular set of anatomical structures. The dictionary includes a list 
  of structures, organized as an anatomical and developmental hierarchy, with 
  descriptions and illustrations of each structure. </p>
