# This directory has a logical (but not physical) association with the
# ZFIN/Workgroup_dirs/AnatDict directory.
#
# Some files in this directory were copied from the FTP pub/AnatDict directory 
# to here and the static web pages were updated to point here, at the time
# the makefile hierarchy was created (late 2000).
