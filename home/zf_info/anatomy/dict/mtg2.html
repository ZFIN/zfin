<h1 align="center"><FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE=4> Summary of the Zebrafish Anatomical 
  Dictionary Workshop <br>
  December 10, 1999 </FONT></h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The use of zebrafish as a model organism for genetic, genomic, developmental 
  and other studies continues to grow. As a result, there is great need for the 
  zebrafish research community to establish a standardized anatomical vocabulary. 
  A dictionary defining the vocabulary and anatomical atlases illustrating the 
  vocabulary will allow consistent use of terminology and will foster cross-species 
  comparisons of gene expression patterns, mutant phenotypes and other studies 
  of gene function. </p>
<p>An initial informal gathering to formulate plans for generating an anatomical 
  dictionary for zebrafish was held during the workshop on Genomic and Genetic 
  Tools for the Zebrafish at the NIH on May 10-11,1999. People attending that 
  meeting agreed on the high priority of developing an anatomical dictionary. 
  The<a href="meeting_sum.html"> report of this meeting</a> is posted on ZFIN.</p>
<p> To move forward toward the goal of establishing the anatomical dictionary, 
  a second meeting was organized by M. Westerfield and R. Toyama at the Natcher 
  Conference Center at NIH on December 10, 1999. The purpose of this meeting was 
  to establish a more detailed plan with specific goals for the dictionary and, 
  ultimately, the anatomical atlases. </p>
<h3>Presentations: </h3>
<p><b>Overview:</b> Westerfield gave an overview of the zebrafish anatomical database 
  supported by ZFIN. Currently, some of the tools required for the anatomical 
  dictionary and atlas are already provided by ZFIN. For example, detailed <a href="../../zfbook/stages/index.html">descriptions 
  of developmental stages</a> and a list of anatomical terms at different stages 
  is available on line and can be modified by workgroup members. The original 
  data and new data are archived; thus, each revision can be reviewed as necessary.</p>
<p> <b>cDNA Expression Patterns: </b>Three groups (Aanstad, Thisse, and Toyama) 
  who are working on large scale in situ cDNA screening projects presented their 
  data organization systems and emphasized the necessity of standardized anatomical 
  terms to annotate expression domains. To search cDNA expression databases on 
  the basis of gene expression patterns, key word descriptions of expression domains 
  are required because it is currently not possible to search by photographic 
  images. Therefore, a standardized anatomical vocabulary is essential. This vocabulary 
  should be organized in a hierarchical manner to indicate relationships among 
  tissue structures and anatomical and functional systems. Several points were 
  made:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some mRNAs may be expressed in a subset of cells that have no corresponding 
    anatomical term. In these cases, identifying and anotating detailed morphological 
    structures by histology will add precision to the definition of the gene expression 
    patterns. </li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>Gene expression patterns may not respect morphological tissue boundaries. 
    Particularly in early embryogenesis, some gene expression patterns can be 
    expected to define areas before histological or anatomical structures are 
    visible. These areas may be evident by gene expression patterns alone and, 
    thus, will require precise topological vocabularies. Gene expression domains 
    can be used as labels/landmarks to name subsets of cells in the embryo prior 
    to the formation of visible structures. </li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>Based on his experience from screening and analyzing axonal patterning mutants, 
    Wilson argued strongly for the creation and organization of a high quality, 
    well-labeled neurohistological and anatomical atlas. Specifically, he suggested 
    that a listing of well-characterized gene markers of brain structures is a 
    required resource for the research community. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Three-dimensional (3D) atlas of the zebrafish</b>: </p>
<p>1) Verbeek presented a 3D-digital zebrafish atlas reconstructed from confocal 
  microscopic and serial section images. He described a computer automated technique 
  to support this project, although some steps still require manual operation. 
  Incorporating gene expression data into the 3D atlas is technically still challenging 
  because current whole-mount in situ techniques are unsuitable for acquiring 
  images by confocal microscopy. The current system uses 20x magnification; it 
  is unclear whether this will provide sufficiently high-resolution for an atlas. 
</p>
<p>2) Weinstein presented a WEB accessible database of a 3D atlas of blood vessel 
  formation during zebrafish embryogenesis. Individual vessels are named based 
  on comparisons with other model systems (human and other fish) Vasculature is 
  quite variable between individuals possibly because of polymorphisms among different 
  strains. Thus, annotations need to be assigned with these issues in mind. This 
  work has been published in Dev Biol. 2001; 230:278-301 and is currently <a href=http://mgchd1.nichd.nih.gov:8000/zfatlas/Intro%20Page/intro1.html> 
  available on line</a>. </p>
<p>3) Cheng described his agarose-embedded tissue array system to handle large 
  numbers of zebrafish larvae simultaneously for histological and genetic analysis. 
  His group has accumulated cytological data of adult and larval zebrafish. Based 
  on his experience in anatomic pathology, he proposed, and Bard reiterated, that 
  the details evident from histological paraffin and plastic sections should allow 
  identification of anatomical parts during embryonic and larval development that 
  correlate with gene expression patterns. Moorman pointed out that these sections 
  could be used to generate 3D images.</p>
<p>4) Bard discussed his experience in establishing the mouse anatomical dictionary 
  and current efforts to generate a zebrafish dictionary. The group agreed that 
  the zebrafish community should model their database after the best features 
  of other model organism databases, including Drosophila, C. elegans, and mouse, 
  and should incorporate links, where appropriate, among anatomical data from 
  different model systems. </p>
<h3><b>Conclusions: </b></h3>
<p>1. The group agreed unanimously that a zebrafish anatomical dictionary and 
  atlas need to be established with high priority. Some of the specific goals 
  are already under way. </p>
<p>2. Our ultimate goal is to generate 3D atlases with histological and gene expression 
  data incorporated in a searchable fashion (virtual zebrafish). This will require 
  development of a standardized anatomical dictionary and atlases that define 
  structures and systems. However, we are aware of the current, urgent need for 
  a dictionary in the research community. Therefore, it ismost important to elucidate 
  the community’s needs and to provide information in a timely manner. </p>
<p>3. The dictionary of anatomical terms needs to be flexible and to support future 
  modifications. </p>
<p>4. To collect sufficient data to start organizing the dictionary and atlases, 
  we agreed to ask the zebrafish community to contribute to this project. It was 
  suggested that we contact people who have expertise in particular tissues and 
  organs and ask them to provide their best histological and gene expression (mRNA 
  in situ or antibody labeling) data (slides, prints, electronic files, etc.) 
  with precise annotations. We will provide a standardized form to be completed 
  by these individuals to facilitate entry of the data into ZFIN. We hope to gather 
  the first round of data within a reasonably short period and will consider obtaining 
  further data if necessary (e.g. additional developmental stages). </p>
<p>5. Finally, data should be reviewed by outside experts to maintain quality 
  and accuracy. </p>
