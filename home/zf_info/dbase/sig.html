<b>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPOSED WORK:</b>
<p>
Zebrafish offer special advantages both for characterizing embryonic development and for designing a database system. The zebrafish embryo, nearly unique among commonly studied vertebrates, contains large
numbers of identifiable cells, some of which have already been characterized
in terms of their detailed anatomical, physiological and developmental
properties (Table 2). In embryos, the zebrafish nervous system, for example, is relatively
simple [Kimmel90], all neurons are visible in living specimens [Westerfield93],
individual identified cells can be transplanted and followed over time with
fluorescent labels [Eisen91a,b], and gene expression can be be monitored and
altered in individual cells [Westerfield92]. Zebrafish also provide a unique
opportunity to apply genetic analysis to the study of development because efficient methods are available for generating, isolating, and
characterizing mutations [Kimmel89, Mullins93]. With the recent advent of a
genetic map [Postlethwait94], methods for generating transgenic zebrafish
[Stuart88], and large scale screens that have generated many thousands of
mutant zebrafish [Mullins93], it is now possible to study the functions of
particular genes. A final important
advantage of zebrafish is that their use as an experimental animal is still
new; relatively few labs are actively studying zebrafish, and communication
among these labs (provided by a newsletter and an Internet news server) is
excellent. At the first open meeting of the entire zebrafish research community
last spring, the pressing need for a unified database was recognized and there
was unanimous agreement to work together to establish an on-line database
system. Implementation of a database system will
significantly enhance our ability to study the functional relationships among
various neuronal properties.

Our goals also have significance for computer science database research: <p>
<UL>
<LI>Using the Internet to connect databases
<LI>Creating a logical data model through collaboration among research
scientists
<LI>Using the WWW client/server model for querying the data
<LI>Integrating multimedia into a relational database system for scientific
research
<LI>Developing a GUI interface with techniques for browsing and querying,
including image/spatial data querying
</UL>
<p>
We plan to use the Internet to create a system of database servers
located initially at two sites linked by the Internet to each other and to
public databases such as GenBank and MEDLINE. We will meet on a biannual basis,
and more frequently by video conferencing, to design the system. The
implementation of the database will be coordinated with the mouse and human
brain database projects. This will aid in understanding relationships among
different vertebrate nervous systems. Linking data describing synteny
relationships, mutant phenotypes and gene expression patterns among species
will provide tools for identifying new developmental genes and the molecular
mechanisms of disease. We intend the database system to serve as a prototype
for other scientific communities.
