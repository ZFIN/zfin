<b>1. PROJECT SUMMARY</b>
<p>
To obtain a comprehensive understanding of development, we need to
characterize the anatomical, physiological, developmental, and molecular
genetic properties of a wide range of different types of cells. However
systematic organization of this information into databases and methods for
rapid and easy access to such databases are still lacking; progress will be
greatly promoted by solutions to this problem.<p>
<p>
We propose to develop a relational database system and a widely accessible user
interface to this database for genetic and developmental information from
studies of the zebrafish.
Zebrafish offer special advantages for this type of analysis at 
single cell resolution.
 The zebrafish,
nearly unique among commonly studied vertebrates, contains large numbers of
identifiable cells, some of which have already been characterized in terms of
their detailed anatomical, physiological, developmental and genetic properties.
Specifically, we propose: <p>

To establish a database system for neuronal, genetic, and developmental
zebrafish data. This will provide meaningful ways of relating various 
properties thus facilitating an understanding of their functions.
To develop a WWW user interface to the database making it universally
accessible for data submission and queries.
<p>
To integrate genetic and developmental information, we must share
scientific results both within and between research communities.  It will
require the establishment of a collaborative group of labs to develop a common
data model and the seamless integration of independent databases into a single logical data resource.
<p>
As a first step, help has already been solicited from a small number of labs
that are willing to represent the zebrafish and mouse research communities to
plan and implement this database system and we have tested initial designs for
a user interface. The data for this system are already being generated by
separately funded research projects. 
<p>
The implementation of the database system will be coordinated with the mouse
and human brain database projects. This will aid in understanding relationships
among different vertebrates. Linking data describing synteny
relationships, mutant phenotypes and gene expression patterns among species
will provide tools for identifying new developmental genes and the molecular
mechanisms of disease.
<p>
Our goal is to design this database system as a model which can also be used to
organize information from other organisms. <p>
