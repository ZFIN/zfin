<H3>The Project</H3>
<B>Background:</B><BR>
A group of us were appointed at the 1994 Cold Spring Harbor meeting on zebrafish genetics and development, to establish an on-line database of information for zebrafish researchers.  We have obtained generous funding from the W. M. Keck Foundation and from the National Science Foundation and The Zebrafish Database Project is underway.  
<p>
<B>Current Status:</B><BR>
  We are currently in the <a href="/zf_info/dbase/PAPERS/WWW6/WWW6-97.html"> 
  process of implementing</a> the Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN) database 
  which runs over the Internet. A small group of zebrafish researchers are testing 
  parts of the database which have not yet been released publically. You can access 
  ZFIN directly at <a href="/ZFIN/">http://zfin.org/ZFIN/</a>. 
<P>
You can read more details of various parts of the database and our design process in the following publications:
<ul>
  <li> The specifications for how data are represented in the database are described 
    in a <a href="/zf_info/dbase/PAPERS/ZFIN_DataModel/data_model.html">data 
    model document</a> written to be intelligible to both computer scientists 
    and biologists.<br>
