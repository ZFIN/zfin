<b>2. SPECIFIC AIMS</b>
<p>
We propose to develop a relational database system for developmental and genetic 
information from the zebrafish
and a user interface to this database accessible over the
Internet. Our goals are:
 a) to provide meaningful ways of relating developmental
information; this will facilitate understanding their regulation and functions. For
example, by knowing which genes are expressed along the pathway of a growing neuronal
axon, which mutations affect expression of these genes, and how the axon grows
in these mutants, we can learn whether specific genes regulate where the axon
grows.  
b) To aid in understanding relationships among different vertebrates, we propose to coordinate implementation of the database with
the mouse and human brain database projects. Linking data describing synteny
relationships, mutant phenotypes, and gene expression between species will
provide tools for identifying new developmental genes and the molecular
mechanisms of disease. 
c) We will design this database system as a model which
can also be used to organize information from other organisms.
As a first step, we have already solicited help from a small number of labs
that are willing to represent the zebrafish and mouse research communities to
plan and implement this database system and we have tested initial designs for
a user interface. The data for this system are already being generated by
separately funded research projects. We propose 2 specific aims:
<p>
1. <i>We will establish a database system for neuronal, genetic, and
developmental zebrafish data</i>. We will integrate into the database a variety
of different kinds of data including morphological (image), physiological
(graphical/spatial), genetic (graphical/spatial, text), and informational
(text) data. Use of a database system will allow meaningful queries based on
the relationships among various data, even data of different types. This
requires that we develop a logical data model which will define the various
data types and the attributes that describe them. This model will be developed
collaboratively by representatives from the zebrafish community, working
together with computer scientists and representatives from human, mouse, and
fly labs.  The zebrafish research community has already appointed a small consortium of labs (in Eugene, Boston and London) who are willing to serve as test sites for development of the database system. Each lab generates a particular type of data that will be entered and maintained in its local database. To make the data widely available to the entire community, we will establish database servers at these sites, linked via the Internet. Each site will implement the same logical data model. We will employ many labs to test the performance of the system; we will evaluate our progress and plan further development of the system at biannual meetings of the consortium labs.
<p>

2. <i>We will develop graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for creating,
maintaining, querying, and displaying database information. </i> We will
establish methods to allow world-wide access to the database system over the
Internet. We will develop a World Wide Web (WWW) and Internet access interface for entering data, submitting queries, and downloading data records to labs everywhere. The user interface will ensure the security, integrity and
compatibility of the data; users will submit new data to and query the database
using terms that are well understood by biologists.
