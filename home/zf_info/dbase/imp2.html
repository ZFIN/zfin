<b>Implementation of Specific Aim 2. WWW Graphical User
Interface</b><p>
Our reasons for using a WWW (HTTP) server as the primary user
interface to the ZfishDB, rather than a more powerful X11 based graphical user
interface include:
<UL>
<LI><i>Generic and ubiquitous access:</i>  Because a variety of users on a wide
range of computing platforms must be accommodated, we propose that all users
access the ZfishDB via a WWW interface. This reduces maintenance cost and time
because we need to maintain only one interface rather than separate clients for
each platform (e.g. Mac, IBM PC and UNIX). WWW clients, like Mosaic, provide an
easy to learn and use GUI which has become universally available and popular.
<LI>
<i>Support of non-technical, non-expert users:</i>  The end users of the
ZfishDB cannot be expected to learn the intricacies of composing queries to the
database directly in SQL, nor can they be expected to memorize the details of
the logical data model implemented by the system. Consequently, the system must
provide an interface that allows users to query the database in terms that are
well understood by biologists. 
</UL>
Although developed specifically for the <i>browsing</i> model of user
interaction, WWW clients allow two other models of user interaction,
<i>symbolic  </i>and<i> visual image querying.</i>
<p>
<i>Browsing</i> allows examination of information retrieved by stored links or
related by contiguity (i.e. consecutive pages). We intend to use the Illustra
HTML data type to store hypertext documents such as journal articles,
abstracts, etc. These documents will be loaded from the databases dynamically
into the <i>WWW Server</i> providing extensive document browsing.<p>
<p>
The recently developed form-filling mechanism in HTML provides a more general
interface for implementing a GUI version of the <i>symbolic querying</i> model
for database retrieval. We will use forms to construct queries from users which
are then processed into SQL queries to the Illustra database. One challenge of
this approach is that although conjunctive logical queries (<a href="fig5.gif">Fig 5</a>) will be easy
to interpret, full logical querying of SQL may not be possible (see
<i>Challenges,</i> below). 
<p>
An innovative aspect of the user interface we propose is <i>visual image
querying</i>. For instance, the user might ask to see all information on genes
expressed in some area of a currently displayed anatomical image, specifying
the area by pointing and clicking (<a href="aim1.html#10">Fig 1</a>). Although selecting coordinates
within the image is simple (using the HTML clickmap), mapping those coordinates
to biological regions (e.g. diencephalon) is non-trivial. Ideally, the system
would apply advanced image analysis to deduce the region of interest. Although
the Illustra "image" supports features like edge detection, we propose a
simpler approach;the submitter of the image annotates it graphically,
demarcating the various regions as polygons in an Illustra spatial data type
based on simple non-ambiguous landmarks identified according to a standard
anatomical model. As the image is added to the database, a spatial map of the
region boundaries is constructed based upon these standard landmarks. This map
defines the clicked regions which also have text labels that refer to other
information in the database [Chang87, Douglas87b]. We will write a dictionary
of terms describing this anatomical model which are semantically compatible
[Fox94] with those being developed for the human (Carlis letter, Section I) and
mouse ([Ringwald94] letter, Section I) databases. If we coordinate design of
the zebrafish data model and dictionary with their mammalian counterparts,
extensive querying across species may eventually be possible.
<p>
<i><a name="1">Challenges and Limitations.</a> </i>An important constraint that affects
interface design is the inherently limited reactivity of the WWW interface. As
mentioned above, HTTP interactions are based on discrete exchanges of
information rather than on the continuous, reactive connections available in
conventional computing contexts. In particular, the interface cannot
continuously and autonomously respond to user action; to get a response, the
user must click on a link or submit a form. Thus, the interface is limited in
its ability to react gracefully to ongoing data entry, graying out items when
they become inappropriate, offering context-sensitive help, etc.
<p>
Another limitation arises from the distributed character of the system. Because
query results must potentially traverse the Internet twice (database-to-system
and system-to-user), some delays will be inevitable. However, we have
purposefully designed the system to minimize network traffic; the "lazy"
retrieval strategy described earlier avoids downloading complete data records
until the user specifically requests to view them. We will also use small
low-resolution "thumbnail" versions of images for most transactions, providing
the user with the option of explicitly downloading the full-size image. With
these methods, the response time can be comparable to that provided by most WWW
servers today.
<p>
Embodying the full power of SQL querying in an HTTP interface designed for
non-technical users presents another challenge. For instance, in the interface
described in the <i>Solutions</i> section (<a href="fig4.gif">Fig 4</a>), only <i>conjunctions</i> of
constraints on the desired data can be specified (e.g. <b>brain
region=diencephalon AND lab name=UOneuroscience AND</b> etc.). This limitation
is pragmatic not fundamental; for advanced users, we can provide an interface
that allows direct SQL queries. We will need to find the best balance between
power and simplicity.
<p>
Finally, mapping spatial input to image queries presents a difficult challenge.
Several forms of visual image querying have been developed including a) Query
by Pictorial Example (QPE); the user formulates a query using a schema of
pictorial data in graphic and tabular form [Roussopoulos88]; b) Query by Visual
Example (QVE) where similarity retrieval is supported; the user draws a rough
sketch of image contents used as a visual key [Hirata92; DelBimbo94]. c) Visual
icon-based systems; the user specifies target image contents by placing icons
in appropriate positions of the graphic display [DelBimbo92; DelBimbo93]. We
propose to explore these innovative forms of image retrieval as future
alternatives to our current implementation using the HTML click-map. This
effort will be coordinated with development of the human (Carlis) and mouse
(Ringwald) databases which have similar goals .
