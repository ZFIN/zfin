<P>	<B>Role:</B>  The FISH class is designed to represent both mutant and wild-type strains of fish. Note that individual generations of a given strain are not represented (i.e. no individual stock numbers); this database is not a stock management resource for a stock center. The idea is that a FISH record represents a particular strain of animal, providing a conceptual container for that animal’s genetic content, namely a corresponding set of CHROMOSOME records that detail the chromosomal abnormalities( if any) of the strain. 
	
<P>	<B>How/Who enters: </B>FISH records may be created and modified by any authorized ZDB submitter, presumably whenever a new strain (mutant or wild-type) of fish is developed.

<P>	<B>Security:</B>  Only authorized submitters are permitted to enter new FISH records. Updates to comments and availability are permitted by the owner (original record submitter) only; updates to chromosomes, phenotype, and related_pubs may be entered by any authorized submitter. All other fields are fixed at record creation; changes to these fields must pass through the DB Admin. 
			
<H4>ATTRIBUTES:</H4>
<P>	<B>name (TEXT, REQUIRED).</B>  This field holds the formal name of the FISH. In the case of a MUTANT, it is expected that this name is often the same as the mutant CHROMOSOME(s) carried by the animal.
<P>	<B>abbrev (TEXT, REQUIRED).</B>  The abbreviation that this strain has been assigned. Usually this is the same as the name of the mutant chromosome, except in the case of double-mutations, where both name and abbreviation are usually a concentration of mutation names. 
<P>	<B>line_type (TEXT, REQUIRED).</B> This field is constrained to be either “mutant” or “wild-type” and must be specified for all records. The majority of records are MUTANT; very few will be wild-type.
<P>	<B>source (TEXT, OPTIONAL).</B> This field contains the ZBD_ID of the SOURCE (i.e. PERSON, LAB, or COMPANY) which currently is able to this strain record provide (living or frozen). Alternatively, the field may contain the key word “DEAD”, signifying that the strain in question is no longer available.
<P>	<B>mother (FISH, REQUIRED). </B>Contains the ZDB_ID of the FISH record of the animal contributing the paternal genetic material.
<P>	<B>father (FISH, OPTIONAL).</B> Contains the ZDB_ID of the FISH record of the animal contributing the maternal genetic material. Could be NULL for clonal lines.
<P>	<B>discoverer (SOURCE, REQUIRED).</B> Contains the ZBD_ID of the SOURCE (i.e. PERSON, LAB, COMPANY) that initially generated this strain. It is NOT necessarily the same as the fish_status attribute, which points to where one can currently acquire the strain.
<P>	<B>lab (TEXT, required). </B>  Specifies the LAB that generated the mutation.  Labs must have an allele designation letter.  Each letter corresponds to a particular LAB.  Letter can be obtained by contacting the DB Admin.
<P>	<B>phenotype (TEXT, OPTIONAL). </B> By default, the phenotype of a FISH strain is defined by the sum of the phenotypes described in the mutant CHROMOSOME and ALTERATION records associated with the FISH record.  However, there may be times when mutations <I>interact</I> (i.e. suppressers/enhancers) when present in the same animal. The purpose of having a separate phenotype field with the FISH record is to allow description of such interactions. Even if there is, in practice, some redundancy between the phenotype fields in the FISH, CHROMOSOME, and ALTERATION levels, this is not a problem.
<P>	<B>segregation (TEXT, OPTIONAL).</B> The attribute is only relevant for mutant FISH, and details how the mutation segregates in each generation.
<P>	<B>orig_crossnum (TEXT, OPTIONAL). </B>If applicable, holds the number used by the originating lab to label the original cross that produced the fish. This information is crucial for tracking down historical information about the fish (e.g. original lab notes).

<H4>Related Info:</H4>
<P>	The table int_fish_chromosome is used to associate fish with the chromosomes that they carry.

<H3>Open Issues/Questions:  </H3>
<P>			<B>Note:</B> The stock# attribute was removed 5/24/96 after Monte and Eck decided that we do not want to keep track of every single tank full of fish using ZDB. That is, this isn’t a stock center management database. Rather, we just want to track whole strains of fish.
<P>			• Does it still make sense to have mother and father if we’re no longer talking about individual fish, but about whole strains of fish? Maybe genetic_bkg is enough.
<P>			•	The format for segregation needs to be specified; type of cross, % of mutant progeny, etc.
