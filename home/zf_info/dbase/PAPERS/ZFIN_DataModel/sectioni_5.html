<P>	<B>Role: </B> The PUBLICATION class implements a bibliographical database for zebrafish research articles. The goal is to catalog publications that are related to other data contained in the database (i.e. listing where those data were formally published), as opposed to providing a fully functional bibliographical database.  The PUBLICATION class allows advanced searching and browsing. 
	
<P>	<B>How/Who enters: </B> There are two ways in which new PUBLICATION records are created. First, DB Admin downloads, processes, and locates references electronically from various commercial and private sources, and incorporates those into the publications database. For example, DB Admin retrieves publications from a publication service, then augments these with abstracts from MEDLINE when they become available.
			
<P>Second, authorized contributors may, if necessary, email a request to the DB Admin asking to have specific publications (presumably related to the data they are submitting) entered into the database. This would happen if a submitter is unable to find the publication in the PUBLICATION database which documents a piece of data being submitted (i.e. the database is incomplete). See Appendix for details on how to enter missing publications.
	
<P>	<B>Security: </B> All new publications are entered into the database by the DB Admin. See Appendix for details on entering missing publications. This avoids a number of security as well as accuracy problems. Anytime someone (e.g. in the course of submitting some related data) finds that a publication is missing from the database, they can e-mail the DB Admin the relevant information in a request to have a new PUBLICATION added.

<H4>ATTRIBUTES:</H4>
<P>	<B>authors (TEXT, REQUIRED). </B>Contains the MEDLINE format author list. Note that a PUBLICATION is connected with the PERSON records of authors dynamically, via the PERSON-PUB intersection table.
<P>	<B>date (DATE, REQUIRED). </B>Holds the date that the paper was published. 
<P>	<B>title (TEXT, REQUIRED). </B> Gives the formal title of the work. No validation.
<P>	<B>source (TEXT, REQUIRED). </B>Describes the journal or other forum in which the paper was originally published. The system expects source information to be entered in standard MEDLINE format (although it is unclear to what extent we can enforce this).
<P>	<B>keywords (TEXT, OPTIONAL).</B> A semicolon-separated list of key words or phrases that are used to index and access the citation.
<P>	<B>abstract (TEXT, OPTIONAL). </B>Holds a short (350 words or less) description of the publication, presumably the abstract of the piece.
<P>	<B>content (URL, OPTIONAL).</B> May contain a hyperlink to either (a) a WWW site (e.g. belonging to author or some publisher) where the actual paper is available in electronic form or (b) a Postscript version of the article, which would be downloaded to one&rsquo;s own client for viewing or printing. 
<P>	<B>News and Views (TEXT, OPTIONAL).</B>  Contains citations to other publications which have subsequently published rebuttals, commentaries, or other discussion on this specific publication.
<P>	<B>Errata and Notes (TEXT, OPTIONAL).</B>  Contains a text paragraph describing any errata associated with the publication. 

<H3>Open Issues/Questions:  </H3>
<P>			&bull; We have said that only the DB Admin can create or edit the PUBLICATION records. Is this realistic? In particular, can we expect DB Admin to stay abreast of all the errata, News and Views for<I> every</I> article in the database?
<P>			&bull; It would be nice to put the actual text of the publication in here as well, possibly minus figures. This is a bad idea, because if the entry contains ONLY plain text all formatting, fonts, etc., are lost. Better to have a link to the postscript version that can be downloaded and printed locally. On the other hand, there is no reason that the link couldn&rsquo;t point to an HTML version that the author or publisher has made available on some site. In sum, having an HTML hyperlink in this field seems to allow maximum flexibility.
