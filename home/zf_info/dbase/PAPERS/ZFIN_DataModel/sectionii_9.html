<P>	<B>Role: </B>  The PRIMER_SEQ class represents primers used to generate various map markers. Rather than being associated directly with such markers, the primers are identified via AMP_PRODUCTs, which group primers into pairs (where applicable) and which are, in turn, associated with the appropriate map markers. A given AMP_PRODUCT must have at least one and at most two PRIMER_SEQ records associated with it. 
	
<P>	<B>How/Who enters:</B>  Initially, PRIMER_SEQs are entered in the course of entering information on existing map markers, and the AMP_PRODUCT records associated with those markers. In the future, it is expected that authorized submitters will add new PRIMER_SEQs, primarily in the course of entering information about new map markers.
	
<P>	<B>Security:</B>  Only authorized submitters are allowed to add new PRIMER_SEQ records to the database; as always, submissions are tagged with the time and the identity of the submitter. After the initial submission, only the source and  related_pubs fields may be changed by authorized submitters; all other changes must go through the DB_Admin.

<H4>ATTRIBUTES:</H4>
<P>	<B>name (TEXT, REQUIRED).</B> Contains the name of the primer.
<P>	<B>source (SOURCE, OPTIONAL). </B>This field holds either the ZDB_ID# of a SOURCE (i.e. person, lab, or company) from which the primer is currently available.
<P>	<B>sequence (TEXT, OPTIONAL).</B>  If the primer has been sequenced, this contains a text string that describes the sequence.
	
<H3>Open Issues/Questions:  </H3>
<P>			&bull;  Is sequence really optional? Isn&rsquo;t the sequence known for all primers?
