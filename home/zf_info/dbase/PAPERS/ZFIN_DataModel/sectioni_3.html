<P>	<B>Role:</B>  The LAB Class supports a listing of labs that are doing zebrafish research. The goal is to provide users with a means for systematically finding basic information about labs.
	
<P>	<B>How/Who enters:</B>  A new LAB is initially created via a formal request to the DB Admin by the head of the lab. This request includes enough information to create a PERSON entry for each of the lab members. Fields except name, location, and contact person are editable by the contact person for the lab (who essentially “owns”  the record). It is this person’s responsibility to keep the lab information up to date; the DB Admin does not routinely do so but can provide help if necessary.
	
<P>	<B>Security: </B> Only the DB Admin can create (i.e. insert) a new LAB record in the database. Other than DB admin., only the lab contact person can change the editable fields. Accordingly, no error checking or validation of any fields is deemed necessary.

<H4>ATTRIBUTES:</H4>
<P>	<B>nonZF_pubs (TEXT, OPTIONAL).</B> Contains unformatted text references to other non-zebrafish publications the LAB has produced, that is, publications that are not, and should not be in the database. 
	<P><B>contact person (ZDB ID#, REQUIRED).</B> Contains a reference to the researcher who is the public liaison for the lab. This is usually the head of the lab. In any case, this is the person responsible for updating the LAB information; this is the only other person (besides the DB Admin) who may change the editable attributes of the lab.
	
<H4>IMPLICIT ATTRIBUTES:</H4>
<P>	<B>members.</B>  A list of a LABs current members is dynamically constructed by way of the PERSON-LAB intersection table (see section IV). Note that this implies that all lab members who want to be listed must be known as PERSONs to the system. A mechanism is provided to allow the designated contact person to update the lab membership.
<P>	<B>publications. </B>By joining across the PERSON-PUB and PERSON-LAB intersection tables, the database dynamically constructs the list of publications produced by a LAB.

<H3>Open Issues/Questions:  </H3>
<P>			•  Should we really allow the LAB’s contact person to update members remotely? Makes sense, but is a bit out of step with our general and very conservative policy of routing all changes to data through the DB Admin.
