<P>	<B>Role: </B> The PART class implements a catalog of all anatomical structures that exist at each stage during developmental. It represents the basic terminological foundation for the zebrafish research community. Though the list of PARTs has no structural information (i.e. which part is contained in which other part) associated with it, the PART catalog can be used in conjunction with the PHYS_STRUCTURE database to generate dynamically the hierarchical structural relationships among the various anatomical parts (see description of PHYS_STRUCTURE). The names of individual PARTs can also be used to index the IMAGE database to extract images that show the part in question. 
<P>	<B>How/Who enters:  </B>All records in the PARTs catalog are entered and maintained exclusively by the DB Admin. Presumably modifications are made only after reaching a consensus among members of the research community. It is assumed that the basic anatomical taxonomy develops through the collaborative efforts of the zebrafish community using the glossary from the published staging series as a start.
	
<P>	<B>Security: </B> Security issues are minimal, because only the DB Admin is able to add or edit records.

<H4>ATTRIBUTES:</H4>
<P>	<B>name (TEXT, REQUIRED).</B>  This field contains the formal, accepted name of an anatomical part.
<P>	<B>abbreviations  (TEXT, OPTIONAL). </B>This field contains a semicolon-separated list of acceptable abbreviations for the part. 
<P>	<B>description (TEXT, REQUIRED). </B>This field gives a textual description of the part, carefully describing the observable characteristics of the part, and perhaps mentioning its origins and eventual fate in the developmental process.  At least some description is required.
<P>	<B>stage_appear (closed set, REQUIRED). </B>This attribute describes the developmental stage at which the anatomical part appears or is initially defined to exist in the animal.  Allowable values are drawn from the developmental stages defined by the Staging Series.
<P>	<B>stage_disappear (closed set, REQUIRED).</B> This attribute describes the developmental stages at which the anatomical part ceases to exist in the animal. Allowable values are drawn from the developmental stages defined by the Staging Series.
