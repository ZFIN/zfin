	<P><B>Role: </B> The abstract category GENERIC_OBJECT defines a common superclass for <I>all</I> of the data classes within ZDB. Consequently, it defines attributes common to all data 
	
<P>	<B>How entered: </B> There are no actual GENERIC_OBJECT records; GENERIC_OBJECT serves purely as an abstract class in which we specify attributes and functionality common to all data items.  Data items in non-abstract classes like IMAGE, GENE, etc., all gain these attributes through inheritance.

<H3>ATTRIBUTES:</H3>
	<P><B>ZDB_ID  (TEXT, REQUIRED). </B>Hold a ZDB_ID for the object -- see the documentation on the ID MANAGER object in Section IV. Briefly, this ID has a strictly defined format and is generated by the system (via a call to get_id) at the time the data object is initially created. It uniquely identifies the data object; no two ZDB_IDs may be identical. For the most part, the ZDB_ID is for system use only, though, in theory, users could utilize the IDs to identify and search for data records.
	<P><B>owner  (TEXT, REQUIRED). </B> This field is also filled in by the system. It specifies the login name of the PERSON who initially submitted this data record. This is known to the system because the person must provide a submitter name and login before being allowed to submit anything. 
<P>	<B>birthdate (DATE, REQUIRED). </B> This field is automatically filled by the system with a time stamp to mark the time and date at which this record was created. Note that we cannot just rely on the Illustra system&rsquo;s &ldquo;tmin&rdquo; timestamp, which records when a row was inserted because we may move tables to flat files, and reload them into new tables many times. Each reload would then in a new tmin date.
