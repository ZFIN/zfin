<P>	<B><H3>Purpose: </H3></B> The data classes described in this section represent the heart of the database project; they intend to capture experimental data and to organize and render it accessible to researchers in the community. 
			
<P>			A distinguishing feature of the data classes described in this section is that they all allow new records to be added remotely by authorized submitters around the world. For example, a researcher in T&uuml;bingen (who has previously become an authorized submitter) who has just discovered a new mutant strain could connect to the database and submit a new MUTANT record describing the new strain, before or regardless of whether the new mutant ever becomes officially known through the regular publication process. In this way, researchers in the zebrafish community can share new and unpublished information much more rapidly than through traditional channels.
			
<P>			The information captured in the data classes described in this section are abstractly organized as follows:
	
<P>			1) <B>Genetic Map Data. </B> Descriptions of genes and map markers that define the zebrafish genetic map.
<P>			2) <B>Stock information.</B>  Descriptions of the strains of fish that have been developed to date in the zebrafish community, including information on where each strain is currently available.
<P>			3) <B>Label information.</B>  Descriptions of cell and tissue labels and stains that have been developed and characterized.
<P>			4) <B>Experimental Results.</B>  Data in this group include mostly photographic images, but also includes other types of data like graphs and electrical measurements.
	
<P>			Importantly, the data in each of these groups are carefully organized and indexed, allowing users to pose abstract queries to extract precisely those data records of interest to them.
	
<P>	<H3><B>NOTES:</B></H3>  The relationships among these classes of data are not completely established yet.  This section is still under development.
