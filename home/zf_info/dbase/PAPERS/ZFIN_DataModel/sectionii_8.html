<P>	<B>Role:</B>   The AMP_PRODUCT class represents groups of primers used to generate various map markers. The reason for introducing the notion of amplification products rather than referring to the primers directly from the map marker is to represent the fact that, in many cases, such primers are used in pairs; paired usage should be evident to someone doing a search on primers. It also allows us to represent the band size produced by such pairings. For map markers for which the amplification product consists of a single primer rather than a pair, the reverse_primer and band_size fields remain NULL. A given map marker (identified by marker_id) may have one and only one AMP_PRODUCT record associated with it.
	
<P>	<B>How/Who enters:</B>  Currently known amplification products (and information on the primer sequences they consist of) are entered by the DB_Admin in the course of entering information about existing map markers. In the future, it is expected that authorized submitters will add new AMP_PRODUCTS as they add or update map marker information.  
	
<P>	<B>Security: </B> Only authorized submitters are allowed to add new AMP_PRODUCT records to the database; as always, submissions are tagged with the time and the identity of the submitter. Once submitted, only additions to the related_pubs field are allowed; all other changes go through the DB_Admin.

<H4>ATTRIBUTES:</H4>
	<B>marker_id (CLONED_GENE, REQUIRED).</B> Contains the zdb_id of the CLONED_GENE which this SEQUENCE record describes. 
<P>	<B>forward_primer (PRIMER_SEQ, OPTIONAL). </B>Contains the zdb_id of the PRIMER_SEQ used as the forward primer to generate the map marker identified by marker_id. If this is a RAPD or other marker that requires only one primer to generate, then this field identifies that primer. In rare cases of RFLPs where no primer (or really amplification!) was used in the mapping, both forward and reverse primer could be NULL, with only the band sizes filled in.
<P>	<B>reverse_primer (PRIMER_SEQ, OPTIONAL). </B>Contains the zdb_id of the PRIMER_SEQ used as the reverse primer to generate the map marker identified by marker_id. If this is a RAPD or other marker that requires only one primer to generate, then this field remains NULL.
<P><B>band_size (TEXT, OPTIONAL).</B> A comma-separated list of integers which describes the size (in base pairs) of the bands produced by this amplification.
<P><B>restr_enzyme (TEXT, OPTIONAL). </B>This text field contains the name of the restriction enzyme used to generate the amplification product. It is NULL if no such enzyme was used.
