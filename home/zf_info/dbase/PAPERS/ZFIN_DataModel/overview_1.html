<P><B>Purpose: </B>The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed description of the data categories designed for the database, how data are specified and by whom, how they are entered, and their intended use within the context of a database query.  
	
<P>	<B>How to use this document:</B>  This is a working document which changes as the design and implementation of the database change.  It is divided into sections which describe groups of data classes.  Each class of data is first described in general terms of its purpose and use. The attributes for each class are then listed and discussed individually.  Our working notes, conversations and open issues are recorded at the end of each data class description.
	
<H3><P><BR>Terminology:</H3>
<UL><BR>• “<B>BOLD</B>” refers to the names of data classes
<BR>• “<B>bold</B>” refers to the names of attributes of data classes
<BR>• The name of each attribute is followed by a description of how it is represented in the database (data type, required or optional).
<BR>• The term “validation”  refers to verification or error-checking of submitted data by the system. For instance, if an attribute is stated to receive “no validation”, then values provided during data entry are blindly inserted into the database, with no further policing by the system.
<BR>• The term “DB Admin”  refers to the database administrator who is the person(s) responsible for keeping this database up to date.
<BR>•  Any attribute value of any data record may be edited or removed from the database by the DB Admin, even if the description for a given attribute does not explicitly say so.  </UL>
