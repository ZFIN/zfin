<P>	<B>Role:</B>  The purpose of the abstract class DATA_ITEM is to represent the attributes and functionality that are common to many of the data items that authorized users submit to the database. For instance, all such items come from some SOURCE.
<P>	<B>How/Who enters:</B>  Because this is an abstract class, there are no instances of DATA_ITEM instantiated. See the descriptions for the subclasses for further information.
<P>	<B>Security: </B> Only authorized submitters are allowed to add new records of any subclass of DATA_ITEM to the database; as always, submissions are tagged with the time and the identity of the submitter.

<H4>ATTRIBUTES:</H4>
<P>	<B>comments (TEXT, OPTIONAL). </B>Contains arbitrary text that further describes the DATA_ITEM, how it was found or derived, or other comments. It may also direct readers to publications or interesting discussions that the submitter feels are of particular interest. This field may be remotely changed by the original submitter.
<P>	<B>primary_pub (PUBLICATION), OPTIONAL).</B> Contains a pointer to the first or primary publication in which this DATA_ITEM was described. If this field is NULL, it is assumed that the DATA_ITEM is as yet unpublished. 
<P>			THIS FIELD NO LONGER PHYSICALLY EXISTS. With the addition of the DATA-PUBS intersection table, this function is accomplished by adding another entry to that table, marked as the first (primary) publication for the given data item. 
<P>	<B>related_pubs  (listof (PUBLICATION), OPTIONAL).</B> Contains a semicolon-separated list of references to other publications related to the DATA_ITEM in question. 
	<P>		THIS FIELD NO LONGER PHYSICALLY EXISTS. With the addition of the DATA-PUBS intersection table, this function is accomplished by adding more entries to that table, marked as the related (secondary) publications for the given data item.  This field may be remotely changed by the original submitter to reflect new publications.
<P>	<B>record_status (TEXT,REQUIRED). </B>This attribute is maintained by the system, and can be used to mark a data item as &ldquo;viable&rdquo;, &ldquo;updated&rdquo;, or &ldquo;withdrawn&rdquo;. This allows the maintenance of older or erroneous data, so that people can still retrieve it and note its non-viable status.
	
<H3>Open Issues/Questions:  </H3>
	&bull;  Sometimes probes derived from genes in other species are used.  Thus, the primary_pub would not be listed in PUBLICATIONS.
