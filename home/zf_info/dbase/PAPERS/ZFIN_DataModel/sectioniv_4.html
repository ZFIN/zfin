<P>	<B>Role:</B>  A key function of the database is to maintain connections between the data contained in the database, and the publications (if any) in which the data were formally presented to the community. That is, the database must associate DATA_ITEMs with PUBLICATIONs. To support document changes to a data record over time (e.g. as more becomes known about a mutant), the database must also associate ATTR_UPDATE with PUBLICATIONS. Because, in general, a given DATA_ITEM or ATTR_UPDATE may be supported by more than one PUBLICATION, and a single PUBLICATION may support several data entries or changes, it makes sense to implement the connection between these two data types as an intersection table.  Queries of this table can easily retrieve all the publications associated with a data item, or all the DATA_ITEM or ATTR_UPDATEs supported by a given publication.  
			
<P>	<B>How/Who enters: </B> Records are created indirectly, as new DATA_ITEMS or ATTR_UPDATEs are entered into the system. Specifically, when the user selects a particular PUBLICATION to support a submission, a new DATA-PUB record is created to connect the two data records. 
	
<P>	<B>Security: </B> Security issues are minimal, because this table is invisible to users.

<H4>ATTRIBUTES:</H4>
<P>	<B>DATA_ID (ZDB ID#: REQUIRED). </B> This field contains the ZDB ID number of a DATA_ITEM or ATTR_UPDATE record.
<P>	<B>PUB_ID (ZDB ID#, REQUIRED). </B> This field contains the ZDB ID of a PUBLICATION associated with the DATA_ITEM or ATTR_UPDATE record specified by DATA_ID.
<P>	<B>PUB_TYPE (BOOLEAN, default=false).</B>  This Boolean value is used to distinguish between <I>primary</I> and <I>related</I> publications that may be associated with DATA_ITEMS. If the publication is the primary publication, then PUB_TYPE=true; else PUB_TYPE=false.
