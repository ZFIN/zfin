<P>	<B>Role: </B> The COMPANY Class supports a listing of companies that produce various biological materials like dyes, probes, and markers. The goal is to provide users a way of finding basic information they need to contact a specific company to order materials. 
	
<P>	<B>How/Who enters:</B>  A new COMPANY is initially created via a formal request to the DB Admin. This request would likely be generated when someone attempts to add a new labeling reagent or commercially available marker to the database, but then finds that the company that produces that reagent is not yet in the database. It is expected that such occasions are quite rare, because the number of such companies is relatively small and stable. 
	
<P>	<B>Security: </B> Only the DB Admin can create (i.e. insert) a new COMPANY entry into the database, so no error checking or validation of any fields is deemed to be necessary.
