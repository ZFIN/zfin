	<P><B>Role:</B>  The abstract category, SOURCE, defines a common superclass for the classes PERSON, LABS, and COMPANY. This abstraction is valuable because in some cases , such as identifying the source of a mutant, RNA probe, marker, etc., users want to specify <I>either</I> a person, lab, or company as the source, depending on which is more practical. 
	
<P>	<B>How entered:</B>  There are no actual SOURCE records; they serve purely as an abstract class in which we specify attributes and functionality common to the PERSON, LABS, and COMPANY classes. That is, records of PERSON, LABS and COMPANY, rather than SOURCE exist in the database.

<H4>ATTRIBUTES:</H4>
<P>	<B>Full_name (TEXT, REQUIRED).</B>  Contains a PERSON&rsquo;s full name. The format is constrained to be &ldquo;LAST, FIRST, INITIALS&rdquo;; it is important to follow this format to streamline searching and printing. If desired, the PERSON may provide full middle names rather than just initials. No validation (e.g. to be sure source really exists) is performed, because entry of new PERSON, LAB, and COMPANY records are done only by DB Admin.  Name can be altered only by DB Admin.
<P>	<B>address  (TEXT, REQUIRED). </B>Holds SOURCE surface mail address, as determined by user (i.e. could be home, work, whatever). No validation is performed by system. A SOURCE can update this field remotely.
<P>	<B>phone (TEXT, OPTIONAL). </B> Holds SOURCE&rsquo;s telephone. No validation. A SOURCE can update this field remotely.
<P>	<B>fax  (TEXT, OPTIONAL).</B>  Holds SOURCE&rsquo;s Fax number. No validation. A SOURCE can update this field remotely.
<P>	<B>email (TEXT, OPTIONAL).</B> Holds SOURCE&rsquo;s email. No validation. A SOURCE can update this field remotely.
<P>	<B>URL (TEXT, OPTIONAL).</B> Holds a SOURCE&rsquo;s home page URL. No validation. A SOURCE can update this field remotely.
<P>	<B>logo (IMAGE, OPTIONAL).</B> Holds a GIF image (1.5"x 1.5", <50k) supplied by the source. In the case of a PERSON, it is presumably a picture of the person, for COMPANY or LAB is usually a logo. If no logo is supplied, then the database uses a default image.
