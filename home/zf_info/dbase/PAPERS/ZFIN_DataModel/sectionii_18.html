<P>	<B>Role: </B> This class allows users to enter non-photographic records.
	
<P>	<B>How/Who enters:</B>  Most of these records are entered remotely by authorized submitters.
	
<P>	<B>Sample Query Scenario:</B>  Has anyone obtained intracellular recordings from muscle cells in a particular mutant?
	
<P>	<B>Security:</B>  Once created, the only field that can be remotely updated by the original submitter is the publications field.

<H4>ATTRIBUTES:</H4>
<P>	<B>kind (closed set, REQUIRED).</B> This field describes the nature of the data contained in the record field. Acceptable values are limited to {current, voltage, optical}
<P>	<B>record.</B> The actual data record or a graphical image of it.
<P>	<B>description (TEXT, REQUIRED). </B>This field gives a textual description of the data, describing the conditions under which the data were recorded, and drawing the reader&rsquo;s attention to features in the data. Similar in nature to a legend on a figure.  At least some description is required.

<H3>Open Issues/Questions:</H3>  
<P>			&bull;  What is the data type of the record attribute? Is it just a numerical vector? Or is it a GIF image of a graph?
<P>			&bull;  This class seems very under-specified. Need to develop the query scenario to understand better how one might go about searching for a specific record.
