<H2>1.0 INTRODUCTION</H2>
The technology of the World Wide Web (WWW) provides a revolutionary means
for dissemination of scientific information. For the first time, scientists
have 24 hour, low-cost international access to central repositories of
research data without the need for specialized client-side software. In
particular, biological researchers have exploited the power of the Web
to create a diverse range of bioscience resources, including several web-accessible
relational databases (e.g., Mouse Genome Database [<A HREF="#8">8</A>],
the Human Genome Database [<A HREF="#9">9</A>], the <I>C. Elegans</I> database
[<A HREF="#5">5</A>], the Genome Sequence Database [<A HREF="#11">11</A>],
and FlyBase [<A HREF="#7">7</A>]). There is also a growing number of other
Web sites serving static HTML documents; by spring of 1996 there were 26
different Web sites for 15 different species, and the number of sites is
increasing at a rate of about one every three to four months.
<BR>
<BR>The biologists and computer scientists constructing these web sites presume
that these web-accessible resources will aid scientific discovery through
more timely, widespread access to better integrated research information.
Although the WWW has made this information <I>physically</I> accessible
to scientists, it is unclear whether it will be <I>cognitively</I> accessible.
Busy scientists want useful, accurate, complete and up-to-date information
without needing to learn and use a complex user interface. Will they be
able to find answers to their questions without resorting to powerful but
complex query languages like SQL? Will they be able to get their answers
quickly without working through endless hierarchies of useless pages? Accessibility
depends upon <I>usability</I>, and usability is critically related to productivity
[<A HREF="#10">10</A>].
<BR>
<BR>Designing a usable interface is challenging. First, the interface design
must observe sound principles of graphic arts and psychology; it must have
a functional layout, recognizable icons, and consistent interaction styles.
Good design will reduce the time required to access desired information
by minimizing misconceptions, mistakes and confusion in the search process.
Second, it must incorporate a deep understanding of what information the
scientist needs in the immediate context of his or her tasks and activities,
and must present this information using language and conceptual models
understood by the scientist.
<BR>
<BR>We have created a Web-based biological database for the zebrafish research
community. The success of our project and the achievement of true accessibility
and productivity depend upon designing, developing, and implementing with
a participatory design approach.&nbsp; The general merits of user-centered design
methodologies have been widely discussed in the hypertext literature [<A HREF="#15">15</A>, <A HREF="#13">13</A>, <A HREF="#17">17</A>]. We have found, however, that the ubiquitous diversity in domain models,
information access tasks, and experimental practices inherent to global
scientific communities requires a more sensitive, participatory approach
in which users are involved in every step of the design process.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Here, we describe our use of participatory design [<A HREF="#18">18</A>, <A HREF="#6">6</A>] and the unique
challenges raised in applying this paradigm to a widely-distributed population
of research scientists. Our experience demonstrates that, by using the WWW as a 
central, globally-accessible forum for design, participatory design techniques can be applied effectively to diverse, widely-distributed user communities.

<H2>
2.0 OVERVIEW OF THE ZEBRAFISH INFORMATION NETWORK (ZFIN) PROJECT</H2>
Researchers using zebrafish to study basic biology, like genetics and development,
are distributed among more than 100 laboratories in 28 countries. The zebrafish
database project evolved out of our earlier Web site [<A HREF="#19">19</A>],
which makes available (in static HTML documents) information on researchers
and labs, a bibliography of publications relevant to the zebrafish research
community, photos illustrating zebrafish developmental stages, and descriptions
of laboratory methods, mutant lines, and the genetic map. The home page
was accessed over 35,000 times in the past 18 months; in May 1997 alone,
14,000 HTML pages were served to 2600 sites located in 50 countries.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>Due to the exponential increase in information in this research area and
the resulting need for more powerful methods of organizing and accessing
these data, the zebrafish research community mandated extension of the
original Web server to create a WWW accessible multimedia relational database
known as the Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN).

<H2>
3.0 PARTICIPATORY DESIGN</H2>
Good design focuses on the ultimate usefulness and usability of an interactive
software product by assessing the requirements and specifications of the
product from the user's point of view, the user's interactive behavior
when using the software, and the context of its use. We have found that
the only way to realize this vision is to relocate the entire design process
to the user's domain. Rather than integrating biological expertise into
a traditional software design effort, our aim has been to integrate computer
support into the everyday situated work activities of research geneticists.
Achieving this goal required the software design team to essentially become
adjunct members of a genetics research lab in order to understand the overall
scientific process, the role of information access in that process, and
the relationships that exist between individual researchers, laboratory
groups, and the research community as a whole.
<BR>
<BR>We began by forging a design team which included both biologists and computer
scientists. We believe that this close collaboration is key to the success of
our project. Creating an abstract
data model for the domain, formally articulating the research processes
that users are engaged in, and structuring of interface actions to match
information seeking tasks all require both biological and technical expertise
to achieve efficiency and usability.

<H3>
Designing for a Distributed Scientific Community</H3>
Applying the participatory methodology to a widely-distributed scientific
community introduces a number of unique challenges. We identify three dimensions
of difficulty: the heterogeneous nature of a scientific community, the
lack of direct access to a significant portion of the community, and the
technical challenges of interface design in the WWW environment. In this
paper, we focus attention on the first two categories; technical challenges
and our solutions to them are discussed elsewhere [<A HREF="#3">3</A>].

<br>
<br>To date, most participatory design efforts have been undertaken within
large companies where the target users are (teams of) workers performing specific tasks within a tight collaborative framework defined by the company's overall production process. In contrast, a
scientific community consists of loosely connected groups of relatively
independent knowledge workers [<A HREF="#2">2</A>], each working on a particular
aspect of the same general problem. Table 1 summarizes the special challenges
encountered in designing for a scientific communities, contrasting them
to corresponding features of a typical corporate context:

</TABLE>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Table 1:</B> Differences between scientific and corporate
design contexts.</FONT></CENTER>

<BR>In general, Table 1 emphasizes the independent, heterogeneous nature of
scientific communities. This has forced us to modify the participatory
design process in a number of ways. Rather than studying and designing
for a single, representative group of users, we have had to come to grips
with the fact that no such group exists in a diverse scientific community.
Although, from a practical perspective, intensive ethnographic user analysis
must be reserved for one or two highly-accessible groups of users, we have
invested much effort in sharing the resulting insights with the remainder
of the community, generalizing our formal models of domain activities and
data to encompass the differences that exist within the community. 
<br>
<BR>
A simple
example is the representation of developmental time within our abstract
data model. Our initial analysis characterized the developmental age of
an embryo in terms of a closed set of named developmental "stages" defined
by the zebrafish community. However, subsequent testing of this characterization
against the work practices of the broader research community revealed that
different laboratories have different conventions for specifying developmental
age, e.g., recording the age of embryos in hours or, more coarsely, in
days. The data model had to be generalized to accommodate these different
metrics while still supporting efficient indexing and retrieval of data.
<BR>
<BR>A related difficulty is the continuously evolving conceptions of what entities,
processes, and relationships exist or are relevant in a scientific domain.
In most corporate contexts, this abstract model of the domain, also known as the <i>domain ontology</i>, is relatively
stable. Although new information may accrue very rapidly,&nbsp; the <I>kinds</I>
of information of interest generally remain the same or change only very
slowly. For example, the domain model for a bank includes conceptual entities
like accounts, balances, credit-to-debt ratios, and so on; this model has
remained relatively stable for decades. This is not true in scientific
domains, where the domain ontology is continually being modified and extended
as the science evolves, new experimental techniques produce new kinds of
data, and new biological entities are distinguished.&nbsp; Thus, we
had to not only allow for easy changes and extensions to the domain data
model, but also to support explicitly the <I>gradual</I> evolution of the
data model from one state to the next without disrupting performance.
<BR>
<BR>Perhaps the most confounding factor in designing shared data resources
for scientific communities is the tension between information sharing and
secrecy. Because research geneticists are all essentially working on the
same problem (i.e., connecting genetic code with biological characteristics)
and because experiments are extremely time- and effort-intensive, sharing
of information as soon as it becomes available is highly desirable. At
the same time, the success of individual scientists hinges on publishing
unique scientific results, motivating researchers to keep information to
themselves. A viable solution to this dilemma must maintain proper accreditation
of work while making new results available soon after they are discovered.

<br>
<BR>
The widely-distributed nature of scientific communities interferes directly
with one of the basic tenets of participatory design, namely the immersive
involvement of designers in the everyday workings of the community. This limitation makes it 
particularly difficult to expose the widespread variations in domain knowledge structure and
scientific practice that exist within the community, so that they can be supported 
in the design. Accordingly, a primary challenge was to find
ways of adapting the participatory design process to a distributed design
context, balancing the need for intensive ethnographic analysis with the
need to expose and accommodate the diverse requirements of the entire community
of users. As discussed in the following section, we addressed this difficulty
using a two-pronged approach, capitalizing on face-to-face collaborative contact with community members whenever possible, while utilizing the WWW to
disseminate information and collect feedback on the nascent data model
and the information access tasks to be supported by the proposed scientific
database.

<H3>
Participatory Design: Process</H3>
<A NAME="fig1"></A>The distinction between the participatory and user-centered
design paradigm centers on the composition of the design team and the status
accorded to users in the design process [<A HREF="#18">18</A>, <A HREF="#6">6</A>].&nbsp; Rather than seeing end-users
as "clients" from whom requirements are extracted and against whom (eventually)
prototypes are tested, participatory design accords end-users first-class membership in the design team, giving them an active role in every part of the design process. We have found that this tight collaboration helps both domain experts and software engineers to develop and maintain a deep, shared understanding of each other's perspectives on the evolving design. In addition, the intimate participation of end-users fosters a level of commitment to the design within the user community that we have never before encountered using other design paradigms. This commitment by high-status scientists is essential in promoting the acceptance of new technology by the rest of the community.
<p>
The basic structure of the design process is the same for both participatory
and user-centered approaches; our design process (Figure 1) follows the
basic steps of user-centered design described in texts like [<A HREF="#12">12</A>].&nbsp; In the
following paragraphs, we describe our execution of each design phase, with
particular emphasis on how we addressed the unique challenges associated
with participatory design for a widely-distributed scientific community:
<p>
<BR><IMG SRC="Fig1-trans.gif" >&nbsp;
<center><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Figure 1:</B> Steps in our participatory design process.</FONT></center>

<H3>
Step 1: Develop database and usability requirements</H3>
The initial step in our design process is to conduct domain and task analyses.
The goal of this step is to produce both database information and interactive
system specifications. However, the biological domain is extremely specialized,
making this analysis very difficult. Development of the abstract data model,
the nomenclature used to label user interface components, and the structuring
of interface actions into information seeking tasks all require deep knowledge
of the domain to achieve efficiency and usability. Accordingly, we began
the design process by forging a participatory design team [<A HREF="#18">18</A>,
<A HREF="#6">6</A>] which includes both biologists and computer scientists.
We believe that this collaboration is key to the success of our project,
not only because it provides domain and task knowledge, but also because
direct involvement of biologists gives them a stake in the success of the
project.
<BR>
<BR>During Step 1 (<A HREF="#fig1">Figure 1</A>) we used primarily ethnographic
methods [<A HREF="#1">1</A>], including interviews with zebrafish scientists,
reading journal articles, attending research talks and lab meetings, and
participant-observer activities such as helping to customize the specialized
software used by one of the labs. In other words we tried to "go native"
in the zebrafish community. We also used questionnaires to gather design
input from scientists around the world, distributing them at workshops,
and via the original Zebrafish Web site, which contains documents on the
development of the database project along with a brief list of the types
of information we expect to include. We solicited feedback from our users
about their satisfaction with the current HTML-based Web site and integrated
their requests for enhanced functionality and information into the design
of the new database. The goal of this immersion in the working world of
zebrafish scientists was to understand the context of their everyday work
activities and its relationship to the proposed WWW database.
<BR>
<BR>In addition to these ethnographic methods, we looked extensively at other
web-accessible biological database sites to evaluate their information
content and user interfaces; we videotaped our own zebrafish scientists
doing simple information retrieval tasks to pinpoint their confusions with
the user interfaces and information models at these other sites. In this
respect, we have found the WWW to be an easily accessible means of drawing
on the design experience of others, a critical resource in an area where
design improvements are typically incremental and based on real-world experience.
<BR>
<BR>These domain and task analyses produced specifications for the database
information and the user interface. Database information specifications
were captured in a data model document intelligible to both computer scientists
and biologists, containing descriptions of database entities, attributes,
and relationships, as well as examples of situations of use for various
pieces of information. The data model serves as the blueprint for database
implementation and offers zebrafish biologists a concise overview of database
contents. The current design for the database is complex and incorporates
21 major classes of information, most of which are highly interconnected [<A HREF="#20">20</A>].
<BR>
<BR>Step 1 (<A HREF="#fig1">Figure 1</A>) also produced specifications for
the interactive system. In particular, functional and performance requirements
of the system were determined <I>as seen from the user's point of view</I>.
The first of these, functional requirements, describes what the system
should do. Our functional requirements include:

<UL>
<LI>
Must provide a security mechanism to ensure that only authorized users
submit data.</LI>

<LI>
Must guarantee reliability and completeness of the data, especially
because much of it is user supplied.</LI>

<LI>
Must have a mechanism to distinguish published data from unpublished
or pre-published data.</LI>

<LI>
Must allow submission of commonly published image types, including
annotations.</LI>

<LI>
Must provide color reliability and reasonable resolution for images
so that information is accurate enough to make science-based decisions.</LI>

<LI>
Must be accessible from multiple platforms, including older machines,
to support universal access to the database.</LI>

<LI>
May need to access other databases concurrently with ZFIN.</LI>
</UL>
Performance requirements, the second type of requirements, state how well
the system should perform from the user's point of view. Thus, performance
requirements define criteria for evaluating the actual usability of the
resulting design used in Step 2 (<A HREF="#fig1">Figure 1</A>) of the design
process. Our performance requirements include:

<UL>
<LI>
Must be easy to learn. We expect user interactions with the database
(retrievals or submissions) to be relatively infrequent, and thus, a typical
scientist might forget how to use the interface between uses. The interface
must be learned as you go (no separate manual) and must provide extensive
on-line help.</LI>

<LI>
Must be fast enough to satisfy most commonly asked questions within
a 10 minute session.</LI>

<LI>
Must provide enough feedback that most searches will find results with
three rounds of querying.</LI>

<LI>
Must keep the user apprised of progress during the data submission
process, allowing the user to "undo" a submission during any step.</LI>
</UL>
It was apparent from our requirements study that we needed to offer a more
usable interface than SQL. Although SQL is extremely expressive, allowing
extraction of very complex database relations, it is practically impossible
for non-database professionals to learn and use [<A HREF="#16">16</A>].
Thus, a primary challenge in the design of the ZFIN user interface was
to determine <I>in advance</I> a subset of queries which would satisfy
the needs of most users and to create a very simple interface for expressing
queries in this subset. This required an extensive understanding of the
domain and tasks.

<H3>
Step 2: Iterate detailed design process</H3>
Step 2 (<A HREF="#fig1">Figure 1</A>) is the heart of usability engineering
methods [<A HREF="#14">14</A>]. After developing the information and usability
requirements, we moved into the iterative refinement phase of the participatory
design process to design and implement the user interface. In contrast
to the traditional waterfall approach, this technique relies on rapid cycles
of design, prototype implementation, and evaluation with real users to
generate the final product.
<BR>
<BR>Rather than implementing the entire database at once, we initially selected
a subset of the database information (i.e. data types) to take through
Steps 2-4 of the design process. This was done primarily for pragmatic
reasons. Some information is of higher priority to the research community
or more mature and complete; staggering development of various data classes
allowed us to make useful information rapidly available. In addition, focusing
attention on just a few types of information at a time proved to be an
effective means of managing the complexity of the design.
<BR>
<BR>Each prototype was immediately evaluated by selecting pairs of zebrafish
scientists and giving them typical data retrieval and submission tasks
to perform. Videotaping these sessions allowed us to analyze the amount
of time required, misconceptions encountered, and other problems with the
interface. We evaluated their performance against the usability requirements
developed in Step 1 (<A HREF="#fig1">Figure 1</A>). Details of how to conduct
this type of performance analysis can be found in [<A HREF="#4">4</A>].
We used insights gained from this analysis to shape subsequent prototypes
in the iterative design cycle.
<BR>
<BR>When we were satisfied with the usability of a prototype, it was made available
via the WWW to 15 zebrafish scientists (acting as beta testers) distributed
among both large and small labs around the world; access to the prototypes
was limited to these testers. Feedback on the prototype was gathered using
a series of short, on-line questionnaires and by including a "comment"
button on each screen of the prototype, allowing users to easily generate
an email message to the developers. In addition, the system recorded the
screens traversed by each user, allowing us to identify areas of particular
interest and to expose problems with the interface. At the end of the beta
testing period, we also interviewed our testers by telephone to discover
any other problems. The prototypes were also demonstrated at special sessions
during professional meetings, with feedback gathered orally and by distributing
short questionnaires.
<BR>
<BR>As a result of this participatory process, we have developed a committed
group of "co-developers" in the user community that is highly representative
of the global community as a whole.&nbsp; As an unexpected benefit, we
found that our participatory approach has greatly increased enthusiasm
for the ZFIN project within the research community. For example, during
the first weeks of the beta testing phase, our data editor was deluged
with requests to be added to the "community members" portion of the database,
as scientists learned (apparently from the beta testers) of the nascent
data resource.&nbsp; We feel that this level of enthusiasm stems directly
from our users' sense of involvement in the design process, and will play
an important role in the ultimate success of the ZFIN database.

<H3>
Steps 3 and 4: Data Collection and Public Release</H3>
Because data collection (Step 3) is a relatively mundane part of the design
process, it will not be addressed extensively here, in favor of a more focused
discussion of usability and interface design issues. Briefly, data editors
were recruited&nbsp; to gather existing domain data from various sources
(e.g. publications, lab notes, existing data archives). These data were
then mapped to the data model developed in Step 2 to populate the database.
<BR>
<BR>Step 4, public release of the database, is an important part of the participatory
design process rather than its abrupt termination; usability analysis will
continue indefinitely, allowing the system to evolve to meet the changing 
needs of users. The commentary forms for gathering user feedback mentioned
earlier in the context of beta testing remain available in the public release.
We are also recording (anonymously) the sequence of screens visited by
each user and the total number of visits to each screen to
determine common usage patterns and to expose areas of confusion. Finally,
we are planning to conduct extensive periodic user surveys, interviewing
a sample of randomly selected registered ZFIN users to assess usage patterns,
good and bad features of the Web site, and interest in future information
support.

<H2>
5.0 CONCLUSIONS</H2>
Rapidly expanding access to the WWW holds incredible promise for increased
data sharing and collaboration within widely-distributed research communities.
Web-accessible databases will make available a much broader range of data
than printed media, including multimedia data types and information that,
although useful, might never be formally published; new findings can be
made available almost instantly, rather than being delayed for months by
a lengthy editorial and printing process.
<BR>
<BR>There are a number of challenging obstacles to such universal accessibility.
First, scientific domains are unusually complex, with domain models that
evolve with the expanding frontiers of the discipline; the kinds of information
accepted as "data" and the research techniques that generate this information
change over time. Consequently, interface design for a scientific database
is much more demanding than for stable, single-use databases.
<BR>
<BR><A NAME="fig9"></A>Our experience with this project demonstrates that participatory
design can be used to manage domain complexity and generate meaningful
usability requirements by focusing attention on the real-world work activities
(i.e. research processes) of users and on the ways in which access to various
kinds of information (data) contributes to these activities. It also demonstrates
that, by using the WWW as a medium for both the design process and the
design itself, participatory techniques can be adapted to contexts in which
the user population is widely-distributed and loosely-organized.
<BR>
<BR>We have focused our work to date on maximizing the accessibility of data
contained in the ZFIN database, applying participatory techniques to streamline
individual data manipulations. In the future, we plan to expand our focus
to support the full research process in which database access is embedded
by developing tools to support database-centered interaction among widely-distributed
members of the research community. Examples include mechanisms for collaborative
shared access to the database, interactive discussion forums, and viewer
commentary appended to specific data records. We envision ZFIN as the cornerstone
of a virtual community of research scientists linked via the WWW, working
together, and sharing a common set of data.
