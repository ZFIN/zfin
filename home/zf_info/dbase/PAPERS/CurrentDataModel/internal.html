<h1>Internal ZFIN document not available</h1>

<p>The link you selected leads to a document that is accessible only to 
ZFIN staff.  The database design document you are reading is one of a 
series of documents that were initially developed for use by ZFIN staff.  
After the documents were developed it was decided that (only) the 
database design document should be made publicly available on the ZFIN web 
site.

<p>Since the database design document is part of a larger set of documents,
most of which are not publicly available, it contains an occasional link to
documents that are not accessible over the web.  
We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.
