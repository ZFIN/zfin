<H2>1.0 INTRODUCTION</H2>

<P>
The technology of the World Wide Web (WWW) provides a revolutionary
means for dissemination of scientific information. For the first
time, scientists have 24 hour, low-cost international access to
central repositories of research data without the need for specialized
client-side software. In particular, biological researchers have
exploited the power of the Web to create a diverse range of bioscience
resources, including several web-accessible relational databases
(e.g., Mouse Genome Database [<A HREF="#r7">7</A>], the Human Genome Database [<A HREF="#r8">8</A>],
the <I>C. Elegans</I> database [<A HREF="#r3">3</A>], the Genome Sequence Database
[<A HREF="#r10">10</A>], and FlyBase [<A HREF="#r6">6</A>] ). There is also a growing number of other
Web sites serving static HTML documents; by spring of 1996 there
were 26 different Web sites for 15 different species, and the
number of sites is increasing at a rate of about one every three
to four months.

<P>
The biologists and computer scientists constructing these web
sites presume that these web-accessible resources will aid scientific
discovery through more timely, widespread access to better integrated 
research information. Although the WWW has made this information
<I>physically</I> accessible to scientists, it is unclear whether
it will be <I>cognitively</I> accessible. Busy scientists want
useful, accurate, complete and up-to-date information without
needing to learn and use a complex user interface. Will they be
able to find answers to their questions without resorting to powerful
but complex query languages like SQL? Will they be able to get
their answers quickly without working through endless hierarchies
of useless pages? Accessibility depends upon <I>usability</I>,
and usability is critically related to productivity [<A HREF="#r9">9</A>]. 

<P>
Designing a usable interface is challenging. First, the interface
design must observe sound principles of graphic arts and psychology;
it must have a functional layout, recognizable icons, and consistent
interaction styles. Good design will reduce the time required
to access desired information by minimizing misconceptions, mistakes
and confusion in the search process. Second, it must incorporate
a deep understanding of what information the scientist needs in
the immediate context of his or her tasks and activities. In other
words, it must present information using language and conceptual
models understood by the scientist.

<P>
We have created a Web-based biological database for the zebrafish
research community. The success of our project and the achievement
of true accessibility and productivity, depend upon designing,
developing, and implementing with a user-centered approach. In
taking this approach, we believe we are relatively unique among
designers of web-accessible data resources. Here, we describe
our use of this method, the specific user interface challenges
we faced, and the resulting design.

<H2>2.0 OVERVIEW OF THE ZEBRAFISH INFORMATION NETWORK (ZFIN) PROJECT</H2>

<P>
Researchers using zebrafish to study basic biology, like genetics
and development, are distributed among more than 100 laboratories
in 28 countries. The zebrafish database project evolved out of
our earlier Web site [<A HREF="#r16">16</A>], which makes available (in static HTML
documents) information on researchers and labs, a bibliography
of publications relevant to the zebrafish research community,
photos illustrating zebrafish developmental stages, and descriptions
of laboratory methods, mutant lines, and the genetic map. The
home page was accessed over 20,000 times in its first year.

<P>
Due to the exponential increase in information in this research
area and the resulting need for more powerful methods of organizing
and accessing these data, the zebrafish research community mandated
extension of the original Web server to create a WWW accessible
multimedia relational database known as the Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN).
<H2>3.0 THE USER-CENTERED DESIGN : PROCESS</H2>

<P>
<A NAME="fig1"></a>
User-centered design focuses on the ultimate usefulness and usability
of an interactive software product by assessing the requirements
and specifications of the product from the user's point of view,
the user's interactive behavior when using the software, and the
context of its use. Our design process (<A HREF="#fig1">Figure 1</A>) follows the
basic steps of user-centered design [<A HREF="#r15">15</A>].
<p>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="Fig1.gif"></CENTER>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=2><b>Figure 1:</B> Steps in the user-centered design
process</FONT></CENTER>
<H3>Step 1: Develop database and usability requirements</H3>

<P>
The initial step in our design process is to conduct domain and
task analyses. The goal of this step is to produce both database
information and interactive system specifications. However, the
biological domain is extremely specialized, making this analysis
very difficult. Development of the abstract data model, the nomenclature
used to label user interface components, and the structuring of
interface actions into information seeking tasks all require deep
knowledge of the domain to achieve efficiency and usability. Accordingly,
we began the design process by forging a participatory design
team [<A HREF="#r4">4</A>, <A HREF="#r15">15</A>] which includes both biologists and computer scientists.
We believe that this collaboration is key to the success of our
project, not only because it provides domain and task knowledge,
but also because direct involvement of biologists gives them a
stake in the success of the project. 

<P>
During Step 1 (<A HREF="#fig1">Figure 1</A>) we used primarily ethnographic methods
[<A HREF="#r1">1</A>], including interviews with zebrafish scientists, reading journal
articles, attending research talks and lab meetings, and participant-observer
activities such as helping to customize the specialized software
used by one of the labs. In other words we tried to &quot;go native&quot;
in the zebrafish community. We also used questionnaires to gather
design input from scientists around the world, distributing them
at workshops, and via the original Zebrafish Web site, which contains
documents on the development of the database project along with
a brief list of the types of information we expect to include.
We solicited feedback from our users about their satisfaction
with the current HTML-based Web site and integrated their requests
for enhanced functionality and information into the design of
the new database. The goal of this immersion in the working world
of zebrafish scientists was to understand the context of their
everyday work activities and its relationship to the proposed
WWW database.

<P>
In addition to these ethnographic methods, we looked extensively
at other web-accessible biological database sites to evaluate
their information content and user interfaces; we videotaped our
own zebrafish scientists doing simple information retrieval tasks
to pinpoint their confusions with the user interfaces and information
models at these other sites. In this respect, we have found the
WWW to be an easily accessible means of drawing on the design
experience of others, a critical resource in an area where design
improvements are typically incremental and based on real-world
experience. 

<P>
These domain and task analyses produced specifications for the
database information and the user interface. Database information
specifications were captured in a data model document intelligible
to both computer scientists and biologists, containing descriptions
of database entities, attributes, and relationships, as well as
examples of situations of use for various pieces of information.
The data model serves as the blueprint for database implementation
and offers zebrafish biologists a concise overview of database
contents. The current design for the database is complex and incorporates
21 major classes of information, most of which are highly interconnected.


<P>
Step 1 (<A HREF="#fig1">Figure 1</A>) also produced specifications for the interactive
system. In particular, functional and performance requirements
of the system were determined <I>as seen from the user's point
of view</I> [<A HREF="#r12">12</A>]. The first of these, functional requirements,
describes what the system should do. Our functional requirements
include:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Must provide a security mechanism
to ensure that only authorized users submit data.
<P>
<LI>Must guarantee reliability and completeness
of the data, especially because much of it is user supplied.
<P>
<LI>Must have a mechanism to distinguish
published data from unpublished or pre-published data.
<P>
<LI>Must allow submission of commonly
published image types, including annotations.
<P>
<LI>Must provide color reliability and
reasonable resolution for images so that information is accurate
enough to make science-based decisions.
<P>
<LI>Must be accessible from multiple
platforms, including older machines, to support universal
access to the database.
<P>
<LI>May need to access other databases
concurrently with ZFIN.
</UL>
<P>
Performance requirements, the second type of requirements, state
how well the system should perform from the user's point of view.
Thus, performance requirements define criteria for evaluating
the actual usability of the resulting design used in Step 2 (<A HREF="#fig1">Figure 1</A>) of the design process. Our performance requirements include:
<BR>
<ul>
<li>Must be easy to learn. We expect
user interactions with the database (retrievals or submissions)
to be relatively infrequent, and thus, a typical scientist might
forget how to use the interface between uses. The interface must
be learned as you go (no separate manual) and must provide extensive
on-line help.
<p>
<li>Must be fast enough to satisfy most
commonly asked questions within a 10 minute session.
<p>
<li>Must provide enough feedback that
most searches will find results with three rounds of querying.
<P>
<li>Must keep the user apprised of progress during the data submission 
process, allowing the user to &quot;undo&quot;
a submission during any step.
</UL>
<P>
It was apparent from our requirements study that we needed to
offer a more usable interface than SQL. Although SQL is extremely
expressive, allowing extraction of very complex database relations,
it is practically impossible for non-database professionals to
learn and use [<A HREF="#r5">5</A>]. Thus, a primary challenge in the design of
the ZFIN user interface was to determine <I>in advance</I> a subset
of queries which would satisfy the needs of most users and to
create a very simple interface for expressing queries in this
subset. This required an extensive understanding of the domain
and tasks.

<H4>Constraints Imposed by HTTP/HTML</H4>

<P>
The functional and performance requirements listed above derive
from the characteristics and tasks of the zebrafish research community.
Interface design for any Web-accessible application is also severely
constrained by a number of basic limitations in the technology
of the Web itself, primarily because the WWW environment was designed
to support distribution of static multimedia documents, rather
than dynamic connections between clients and server-side applications.
This bias is reflected in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the
simple formatting language used to control interface layout, and
in Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the communication protocol
used to implement client-server interaction. By limiting the interface
primitives available to the designer and the ways in which client
and server can interact, HTML and HTTP impose a number of unusual
constraints on interface design: 
<OL>
<B>Inconsistent Look and Feel.</B> A basic premise of HTML is
that the language should <I>logically</I>&nbsp;describe the appearance
of interface screens, relegating to the client software low-level
decisions associated with physically displaying the page. Despite
recent improvements, control over the layout and appearance of
interface elements remains relatively weak. Consequently, appearance
of the interface may vary widely depending upon the client hardware
platform and browser software used to access the interface. 
<P>
<B>Discrete Transaction Model.</B> The HTTP protocol supports
only discrete transactions between client and server. Each transaction
retrieves a single HTML document. Transactions may be initiated
only from the client side; the server cannot spontaneously send
information to the client. 
<P>
<B>Anonymous, Stateless Transactions. </B>Both HTTP server and
client treat each transaction as completely independent of preceding
transactions. Though both typically maintain some record of document
access, this record plays no role in shaping the retrieval or
appearance of future documents. Moreover, the HTTP protocol does
not provide integrated mechanisms for distinguishing between transactions
at the user (client) level, meaning that transactions are essentially
anonymous. 
</ol>

These constraints interfere with some basic principles and techniques
of modern interface design. For example, the lack of consistent
appearance and spatial positioning across different platforms
makes it impossible to rely on fine-grained presentational similarities
to convey information about interface behavior. The discrete,
stateless transaction model does not support interface concepts
that &quot;span&quot; several interface screens (e.g. user authentication,
navigation, context-sensitive help); it also rules out most forms
of event-based feedback (e.g. immediate error-checking of input,
graying of inappropriate menu choices in response to other selections)
and powerful interaction techniques like direct manipulation.


<P>
The functional requirements and performance requirements combine
with the constraints imposed by HTML and HTTP to drive the interface
design. 
<H3> Step 2: Iterate detailed design process</H3>

<P>
Step 2 (<A HREF="#fig1">Figure 1</A>) is the heart of usability engineering methods
[<A HREF="#r13">13</A>]. After developing the information and usability requirements,
we moved into the iterative refinement phase of the user-centered
design process to design and implement the user interface. In
contrast to the waterfall approach used by traditional software
engineers, this technique relies on rapid cycles of design, prototype
implementation, and evaluation with real users to generate the
final product. 

<P>
Rather than implementing the entire database at once, we initially
selected a subset of the database information (i.e. data types)
to take through Steps 2-4 of the design process. This was done
primarily for pragmatic reasons. Some information is of higher
priority to the research community or more mature and complete;
staggering development of various data classes allowed us to make
useful information rapidly available. In addition, focusing attention
on just a few types of information at a time proved to be an effective
means of managing the complexity of the design. 

<P>
Each prototype was immediately evaluated by selecting pairs of
zebrafish scientists and giving them typical data retrieval and
submission tasks to perform. Videotaping these sessions allowed
us to analyze the amount of time required, misconceptions encountered,
and other problems with the interface. We evaluated their performance
against the usability requirements developed in Step 1 (<A HREF="#fig1">Figure 1</A>). Details of how to conduct this type of performance analysis
can be found in [<A HREF="#r2">2</A>]. We used insights gained from this analysis
to shape subsequent prototypes in the iterative design cycle.


<P>
When we were satisfied with the usability of a prototype, it was
made available to 10 zebrafish scientists (acting as beta testers)
through the WWW; access to the prototypes was limited to these
testers. A &quot;comment form&quot; was integrated into each screen,
allowing our testers to record feedback easily and email it to
the developers. At the end of the beta testing period, we also
interviewed our testers to discover any other problems.
<H3> Steps 3 and 4: Data Collection and Public Release</H3>

<P>
Because data collection (Step 3) is not an intrinsic part of the
user-centered design process, it will not be addressed here, in
favor of a more focused discussion of usability and interface
design issues. Step 4, public release of the database, is an important
part of the user-centered design process rather than its abrupt
termination; usability analysis will continue indefinitely, allowing
the system to evolve to meet the changing demands of users. The
commentary forms for gathering user feedback mentioned earlier
in the context of beta testing remain available in the public
release. We are also recording (anonymously) the sequence of screens
visited by each user and the total number of visits to each screen
in an effort to determine common usage patterns and to expose
areas of confusion. Finally, we are planning to conduct extensive
periodic user surveys, interviewing a sample of randomly selected
registered ZFIN users to assess usage patterns, good and bad features
of the Web site, and interest in future information support.

<H2>4.0 USER-CENTERED DESIGN: PRODUCT</H2>

<H3>4.1 User Interface Architecture</H3>

<P>
Although several research efforts have produced interfaces to
interactive server-side applications that rely solely on the mechanisms
available in HTML/HTTP [<A HREF="#r14">14</A>], we found it impossible to satisfy
our demanding usability requirements within these constraints.
Therefore, our implementation integrated three powerful concepts
to enhance significantly the expressive power of the ZFIN interface:


<P>
<ul>
<B>Interface state.</B> The ZFIN architecture takes advantage of
the underlying database to store and maintain information about
users and interface state. In combination with user authentication,
this provides strong support for data security, navigation and
context-sensitive help.
<P>
<B>Personalized interaction.</B> By providing mechanisms for authenticating
and identifying individual users, the ZFIN interface tailors its
presentation to meet the specific needs of each user.
<P>
<B>Client-side mechanisms.</B> Responsiveness and feedback of
the interface is enhanced by taking advantage of client-side processing
wherever possible, distributing responsibility for interface management
more evenly between client and server.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="fig2"></a>
We implemented these concepts in a hybrid processing architecture
that augments conventional HTML specification with the storage
capabilities of the underlying database, the computational and
formatting capabilities of a powerful scripting language, and
the interactivity enhancements of client-side processing (e.g.
Java and Javascript) to create a flexible, reactive interface
programming environment. <P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="Fig2.gif"></CENTER>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=2><b>Figure 2:</b> Schematic overview of the interface
architecture implemented in ZFIN. For clarity, the schematic focuses
on data retrieval; data submission is similar, except data also
flow from the interface back to the database.</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
Four distinct mechanisms are transparently integrated to create
the user interface (<A HREF="#fig2">Figure 2</A>): a relational database, dynamically
generated HTML pages, Java applets and static HTML pages. Static
HTML pages are the most trivial component and warrant no further
discussion, especially because they are only rarely used in our
dynamic interface (e.g. for displaying introductory descriptions).


<P>
Dynamic page generation, shown on the left in <A HREF="#fig2">Figure 2</A>, creates
the majority of interface screens in ZFIN. Raw &quot;application
pages&quot;, consisting of static elements interspersed with scripted
processing instructions, are stored as text in a database table.
We used two distinct types of scripted instructions: database
scripts, which control the content and appearance of the returned
page, and Javascript, which controls client-side dynamics like
checking input for errors, enforcing semantic constraints, and
updating the navigation display (discussed in upcoming sections).


<P>
As an application page is retrieved from the database, it undergoes
a sequence of transformations to generate the final interface
screen presented to the user. First, the database scripts embedded
in the page are executed, issuing SQL statements to the database
server and using the returned values to control page layout and
to populate the nascent HTML page with formatted data. These scripts
may also generate and embed page-specific Javascript instructions
to control dynamic client-side behavior. Variables passed in the
original page request are also available to the script interpreter,
and may shape the returned page. The resulting HTML page is passed
back to the user's browser, which executes any embedded Javascript
instructions and displays the final product.

<P>
Although this layering of scripting mechanisms greatly enhances
flexibility, the end product is still HTML, which does not support
dragging, pointing and other forms of direct manipulation. For
some tasks, there was simply no way to meet the usability criteria
developed Step 1 (<A HREF="#fig1">Figure 1</A>) of our design process without access
to these more advanced interaction techniques. Thus, the architecture
also allows the integration of special purpose Java applets<A HREF="#f1"><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT></SUP></A> to
implement advanced interface functionality. 

<P>
The only cost incurred by this architecture is a slight decrease
in accessibility; the integration of client-side technologies
like Java and Javascript means that, to access the interface,
users must have browsers that support these technologies. 

<H3>4.2 User Interaction: The ZFIN Interface</H3>

<A NAME="fig3"></a>
<P>
The interface supports four primary interaction modes 
(<A HREF="#fig3">Figure 3</A>): surveying
database contents and activities, querying to retrieve information,
submitting and updating data, and using specialized data manipulation
tools. <p>


<CENTER><IMG SRC="Fig3.gif"></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=2><b>Figure 3:</B> Four Interaction Modes supported
by the ZFIN Interface. Arrows indicate the relationships of modes
within the context of an interaction.</FONT></CENTER>
<H4>4.2.1 Surveying Database Contents and Activities</H4>

<P>
Our analysis of usability requirements during Step 1 of the design
process showed an overwhelming demand for immediately productive,
efficient access to information for untrained users. 
<p>
The ZFIN &quot;home page&quot; (<A HREF="#fig4a">Figure 4a</A>) meets this requirement
by immediately presenting users with an overview of available
data and accessible activities. In this way, the interface establishes
a simple conceptual model of the data space and streamlines the
most common access scenario, namely, performing a basic search
for information. The &quot;status&quot; of the data in each category
is indicated, priming users' expectations about data integrity
and completeness. 

<P>
<A HREF="#fig4a">Figure 4</A> also illustrates how the concept of personalized interaction
[<A HREF="#r17">17</A>] simplifies the interface. By distinguishing among users,
both as individuals and as members of pre-defined groups, the
interface presents each user with a customized perspective that
contains only those elements accessible to the user. In this way,
the interface focuses the user's attention on relevant activities,
while concealing unnecessary complexity. For example, when users
access ZFIN, they are initially classified as &quot;guests&quot;,
permitting them free viewing access to all data, but barring them
from submitting updates or new data. The latter activities are
reserved only for &quot;data submitters&quot;, scientists within
the zebrafish research community who have applied for and received
authorization to submit data. <A HREF="#fig4b">Figure 4b</A> shows the lower portion
of the home page seen by Ted, a member of the &quot;data submitter&quot;
group, after he has logged in. As a data submitter, Ted has access
to a set of activities centered around data submission which are
unavailable to guest users (<A HREF="#fig4a">Figure 4a</A>). Note, however, that Ted
is unable to add new persons or publications to the database;
these activities are reserved for the unrestricted &quot;database
administrator&quot; group, of which Ted is not a member. 

<P>
We implemented identification of individual users by using the
&quot;HTTP cookie&quot; mechanism [<A HREF="#r11">11</A>] in combination with a table
of user information stored in the underlying database. When a
user logs in, name and password are checked against the user table
and, if successful, a randomly generated &quot;identity key&quot;
is installed as an HTTP cookie in the user's browser; the key
is also associated with the user's record in the database. With
every subsequent transaction, the user's browser passes the cookie
to ZFIN to establish identity and permission status. This interface
then uses this information during the dynamic page-generation
process to determine whether the user has permission to access
a requested page and, if so, which activities to make accessible
to the user within the page.

<P>
The ZFIN home page (<A HREF="#fig4a">Figure 4a</A>) also establishes the overall layout
of the interface, with navigation tools, help, and lab notebook
available at the top of each screen, and a &quot;content&quot;
area below. This structure is consistently maintained throughout
subsequent screens. 

<H4>4.2.2 Querying to Retrieve Information</H4>

<P>
Focused search is very different from the more general browsing
activity supported by traditional WWW sites; users typically have
a well-defined set of target criteria in mind when they initiate
the search. A successful interface must allow efficient expression
of these criteria using domain terminology, must summarize search
results, and must maintain the connection between search criteria
and matching records. 
<P>
<A HREF="#fig5a">Figure 5</A> presents the search interface implemented in ZFIN. The
simple layout and limited number of search criteria reflect our
commitment to accessibility and ease of use rather than expressive
power. Although the underlying database query language (SQL) allows
formulation of arbitrarily complex queries, the interface limits
constraints to conjunctions of a handful of criteria identified
by our domain analysis as most useful (i.e. most discriminating,
most likely to be known at time of search). 

<P>
The interface maintains the conceptual connection between search
criteria and search results by juxtaposing them on the same screen;
there can be no confusion about the criteria that produced the
currently displayed set of records. More generally, the spatial
relationship between criteria and results visually relates the
user's goals and actions to the responses produced by the system.
This arrangement also makes iterative refinement of the search
very easy, applying new constraints while observing the effect
on the set of matching records. 

<P>
The two screens shown in <A HREF="#fig5b">Figure 5</A> also illustrate the consistency
of the search interface between data classes. Although the criteria
are different for each class, the basic screen layout and search
process are identical. 

<H4>4.2.3 Data Submission and Updating. </H4>

<P>
Support for user submission and updating of experimental data
is one of the most important and unique features of the ZFIN interface.
We encountered four primary challenges during our design of the
data submission interface: supporting naive users, enforcing data
security, supporting multi-step submissions, and providing context-sensitive
navigation and help. 

<P>
<I><B>Supporting naive users.</B></I>
<BR>
To support inexperienced users, the data submission interface
provides instantaneous feedback wherever possible, checking entries
for correct format and enforcing semantic constraints between
fields. For example, error dialogs appear when values are out
of range, incorrectly formatted, or incompatible with previously
specified values. We implemented this feature by embedding context-specific
Javascript instructions in each data submission screen. 
<P>
Another important ease of use heuristic employed in the interface
is the preference for popup menus over text entry (<A HREF="#fig6a">Figure 6a</A>).
Popup menus are particularly helpful to infrequent and inexperienced
users who may not remember or know the possible values or valid
data formats for each field. They also provide a convenient means
of enforcing uniform biological nomenclature, increasing the effectiveness
of data indexing and retrieval.

<P>
<I><B>Enforcing data security .</B></I>
<BR>
In any network environment, allowing remote data modification
greatly increases the risk to data security. Our user authentication
mechanism conveniently enforces data security, selectively restricting
access to allowed data manipulation activities. The interface
enforces security not only at the page level, but on a feature
by feature basis within each page. For example, the interface
allows the user to update his or her personal record (<A HREF="#fig6b">Figure 6b</A>),
<I>except</I> name and publications; these options appear only
to the database administrator. 

<P>
<I><B>Supporting a nested, multi-page submission process.</B></I>
<BR>
The interdependence of experimental data presented a major challenge
in the design of the data submission interface. A &quot;data submission&quot;
includes not only new information, but also specifying the myriad
relationships between that datum and other records contained in
the database. The need to establish connections between a new
record and related records results in a complex, nested data submission
process in which the submitter must digress repeatedly from the
main submission task to search for and create links to related
information. 
<P>
For example, a submitter must digress from the primary task of
submitting a new mutation (<A HREF="#fig7">Figure 7a</A>) to search for the publication
(<A HREF="#fig7">Figure 7b</A>) in which the mutation was first described (i.e. primary
publication). After finding the publication, the user selects
it and automatically returns to the mutant submission form (<A HREF="#fig7">Figure 7c</A>). 

<P>
The basic HTTP/HTML environment cannot accommodate this complex,
nested sequence of task and digressions (subtasks) because it
supports no notion of interface state. The central difficulty
lies in managing the automatic &quot;return&quot; from a subtask
to the task from which it was initiated, bringing the information
specified in the subtask back to the primary task. 

<P>
We implemented this functionality by saving interface state<A HREF="#f2"><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT></SUP></A> in
the underlying database and passing a reference (pointer) to that
state to pages associated with the selected subtasks. Specifically,
the record of interface state captures two important pieces of
information as a digression is initiated: the values contained
in the partially completed data submission form and the position
(i.e. viewport) within that form to which the interface should
return when the digression ends. As a first step in any digression,
a &quot;temporary&quot; record is created in the database and
filled with the current values of the form's input fields. The
unique identifier for this &quot;stack frame&quot; is then passed
along to subsequent pages as a hidden form element. When the digression
ends, the values stored in the temporary record are retrieved
and the original form reconstructed; from the user's point of
view, the interface has &quot;returned&quot; to a previous screen.


<P>
<I><B>Providing context-sensitive navigation and help.</B></I>
<BR>
Not all digressions are as straightforward as the one presented
in <A HREF="#fig7">Figure 7</A>. A submitter may need several tries to fine-tune search
criteria, or may need to view one or more records in the candidate
set before selecting one. This raises another prominent design
challenge: during &quot;deep&quot; digressions, users easily become
confused about the relevance of the current screen to the task
solution process as a whole. In other words, users tend to &quot;get
lost&quot; in the task space. Left unsupported, their only remedy
is to return to the home page and start over. 

<P>
Initially, we assumed that the history mechanisms built into most
browsers would adequately support navigation through the task
space, allowing users to view and move back through a list of
previously traversed pages. However, our usability testing revealed
a crucial difference between casual browsing and task-oriented
data access. In a task-solution process, a one-to-many (rather
than a one-to-one) correspondence exists between the physical
pages retrieved and the conceptual steps within the process. For
example, iteration of the search-retrieve cycle (i.e. while refining
constraints) generates a lengthy sequence of retrieved pages associated
with the same <I>conceptual</I> step (i.e. find candidate data)
in the search task. All of these pages appear in the browser's
history list, leaving the user confused as to where they all came
from (not realizing that each new search generated a new page)
and how to get back to the preceding step in the task. What is
needed is a <I>task-sensitive</I> mechanism that maintains a user's
orientation within the task space by tracking his or her progress
through the <I>conceptual</I> steps within each task. 

<P>
The ZFIN navigation tool provides users with a dynamically-updated
representation of their current position within the task space.
Beginning with the &quot;home page&quot;, tiles corresponding
to each conceptual step in a task appear in the &quot;control
strip&quot; found at the top of each page (see Figures 4-7) as
the user embarks on that step. At any point within a digression,
a click on the tile representing some earlier, enclosing step
aborts the digression, instantly returning the user to the earlier
step. 

<P>
The explicit representation of the user's current task also supports
a powerful context-sensitive help mechanism. Because the interface
maintains a complete history of a user's interaction, it is able
to provide specific guidance on how to complete the current task.


<H4>4.2.4 Specialized Tools</H4>

<P>
Although the interface features described in the preceding sections
on searching and data submission are adequate for describing,
retrieving, and displaying text data, they do not efficiently<A HREF="#f3"><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>3</FONT></SUP></A>
support manipulation of complex, domain-specific data types like
annotated images and genetic maps. 
<P>
We developed two Java applets to support these data types. The
image annotator (<A HREF="#fig8a">Figure 8a</A>) allows the user to place annotations
dynamically on a submitted image. The genetic mapping engine (<A HREF="#fig8b">Figure 8b</A>)
 is a sophisticated tool for analyzing the spatial relationships
among genetic markers appearing on a selected segment of a chromosome.
Both applets communicate directly with the database server to
retrieve data required by the applet or, in the case of annotations,
to add information to the image record. These specialized tools
enhance usability by supporting directly the conceptualizations
of domain data prevalent in the biological domain, transparently
mapping them to underlying data representations.
<H2>5.0 CONCLUSIONS</H2>

<P>
Rapidly expanding access to the WWW holds incredible promise for
increased data sharing and collaboration within widely-distributed
research communities. Web-accessible databases will make available
a much broader range of data than printed media, including multimedia
data types and information that, although useful, might never
be formally published; new findings can be made available almost
instantly, rather than being delayed for months by a lengthy editorial
and printing process. 

<P>
There are a number of challenging obstacles to such universal
accessibility. First, scientific domains are unusually complex,
with domain ontologies that evolve with the expanding frontiers
of the discipline; the kinds of information accepted as &quot;data&quot;
and the research techniques that generate this information change
over time. Consequently, interface design for a research database
is much more demanding than for stable, single-use databases.
From a practical perspective, the WWW environment imposes challenging
constraints on the design on a web-accessible interface, severely
limiting the interface concepts and interaction techniques available
to the designer.

<P>
<A NAME="fig9"></a>
The case study presented here shows how user-centered design can
be used to manage domain complexity and generate meaningful usability
requirements, by focusing attention on the real-world work activities
(i.e. research processes) of users and on the ways in which access
to various kinds of information (data) contributes to these activities.
It also demonstrates how the constraints imposed by the WWW environment
can be greatly ameliorated by extending the rudimentary interaction
model defined by HTTP/HTTP with three powerful concepts: interface
state, personlized interaction, and client-side dynamics. <p>

design process (upper level).</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
<A HREF="#fig9">Figure 9</A> summarizes our observations on the relationships among 
these underlying interface concepts, the specific interface features
they give rise to, and the ways in which these features support
the usability criteria generated by our user-centered analysis.


<P>
At the implementation level, our work demonstrates that the integration
of several technologies, an underlying database, HTML, database
scripting, Javascript and Java, establishes a flexible substrate
for creating expressive and reactive web-accessible interfaces.
By judiciously interweaving these technologies to capitalize on
their respective strengths, the ZFIN interface architecture defines
a pragmatic balance between simplicity and expressive power.

<P>
We have focused our work to date on maximizing the accessibility
of data contained in the ZFIN database, applying user-centered
techniques to streamline individual data manipulations. In the
future, we plan to expand our focus to support the full
research process in which database access is embedded by developing
tools to support database-centered interaction among widely-distributed
members of the research community. Examples include mechanisms
for collaborative shared access to the database, interactive discussion
forums, and viewer commentary appended to specific data records.
We envision ZFIN as the cornerstone of a virtual community of research
scientists linked via the WWW, working together, and sharing a
common set of data.

<H3>Notes</H3>

<A NAME="f1"></a>
<li> This observation raises an obvious question: if
Java supports the full expressive power of a modern interface
programming environment, why not implement the <I>entire</I> interface
as a Java applet, completely avoiding all constraints associated
with HTML/HTTP? Several factors make this impractical. First,
increased expressive power comes at the price of increased complexity.
Implementing even relatively simple interfaces requires the sustained
efforts of a skilled programmer; subsequent revisions compound
this effort. We also found that the performance of Java applets
varies widely, depending on the capabilities of client-side hardware
and software. For these reasons, the ZFIN interface relies on Java
only for those interface elements that can not be supported in
any other way.
<P>
<A NAME="f2"></a>
<li> Note that this enhancement is theoretically significant,
upgrading the underlying model of the task space from a finite
state automaton to a more powerful push-down automaton.
<p>
<A NAME="f3"></a>
<li> Although one could conceivably implement functionally
similar tools using only HTML (e.g. using clickmaps), the resulting
interface would be extremely unwieldy, because every action requiring
a response by the system would require a server transaction to
refresh the display.
