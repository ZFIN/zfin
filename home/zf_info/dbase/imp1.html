<b>5. The Implementation Statement:</b><p>
We propose a "distributed" database system, ZfishDB, accessed and maintained over the Internet by the zebrafish research community. Here we describe the
implementation of our three aims. <p>
<p>
<b><i>Implementation of Specific Aim 1. A Multi-media Database. </b></i><p>
<b><a name="1">Limitations of Existing Systems.</a></b> The type of database system we
propose to implement must support image and spatialized graphical data in
addition to text information (<a href="prob.html#1">Table 1</a>). One strategy might be to adapt or
expand an existing system. We have reviewed two possible candidates and found
both lacking. First is our WWW server for the zebrafish research community at
the University of Oregon [<a href=""></a>]. It includes information on
stocks of mutant fish, developmental staging, addresses of researchers, a
bibliography of zebrafish research, etc. Although this system provides a
valuable service, it has significant limitations when compared to a true
database system. Because there is no data model, WWW client-server software (or
any HyperText Markup Language (HTML) based browser) offers only simple file
contents browsing, not querying. Additionally, all data must be tediously
entered and linked by hand in the HTML source files. The zebrafish community
needs model-based data organization and searching that only a true database
system will provide.
<p>
Second, we adapted the ACeDB system [Durbin92] used by the worm community.
ACeDB is a "home-grown" system specifically optimized for genetic map
information. ACeDB lacks the full power of a relational database because it
does not provide ad hoc querying like Structured Query Language (SQL
[Robbins94]). Moreover, ACeDB does not store images within its database
structure; the UNIX version can call an external viewer for image presentation,
however the image and viewer are both external to the system, only the filename
of the image is in the database thus precluding relational queries. Finally,
ACeDB is not a complete DBMS because it lacks standard DBMS features like
concurrency control, recovery, and transaction control.
<p>
<b><a name="2">Needed Approach:  An Object-Oriented Relational Database System.</a></b>Ê Because no suitable biological database systems exist, the DBMS
must come from a commercial source and support:
<UL>
<LI>User defined data types
<LI>A standard language for relational queries
<LI>Image, spatial and temporal data types
<LI>Security, query optimization, and data integrity
</UL>
To satisfy these requirements, we propose to use an Object-Oriented Relational
Database Management System (ORDBMS). A relational database system supports an
abstract data model that separates the logical data model from the low-level
data structures and forms the foundation for relational querying. Adding
object-oriented modeling [Gray92] to a relational database creates important
advantages including inheritance and class structures; and its user-definable
types, functions, and methods seem well-suited to the description of
multi-media biological data. Moreover, an ORDBMS will provide traditional DBMS
support for security, query optimization, data integrity and recovery.

Fig 6 shows a preliminary data model for the ZfishDB, a multi-media ORDBMS. The
hierarchical object structure provides a data representation that is easy to
communicate; we will develop the final data model collaboratively with the
database users. The ZfishDB stores images and text documents as natural types.
Although image and other multi-media data can be added to relational databases
by using uninterpreted Binary Large OBjects (BLOBs), we favor an ORDBMS because
object-oriented technology can easily add new data types (e.g. image, spatial,
video), to traditional relational databases, as first-class data types .
<p>
<b><a name="3">Proposed DBMS<//a></b>. We propose to implement the ZfishDB in an ORDBMS
called Illustra (Illustra Information Technologies, Inc.) which we have used
previously [Shoop94]. Illustra is the commercialization of UC Berkeley's
POSTGRES database research project under Michael Stonebraker [Stonebraker93].
Illustra provides direct support for all the database requirements we have
specified above; it has extensible data typing and allows traditional
relational data types defined in SQL-89 such as character strings, integers,
floating point numbers, etc. In addition, Illustra supports image, 2-D and 3-D
spatial objects, text and HTML document data types. The image data type
provides image and edge enhancement, edge detection and matching, and a variety
of internal image formats. The 2-D and 3-D spatial data types support point,
box, circle, polygon, and directed graph objects, efficiently accessed using
R(quad)-trees. The text document data type allows the storage of journal
articles, notes, manuals, etc. Functions are available for automatic indexing
of documents and for searching all words and phrases in a large text library
using a D-tree access method. We will use all these data storage types.
<p>
We also require the specialized software tools for handling image creation,
editing, and scanning provided by Illustra, which support X11 data viewers
(e.g. XVIEW, XV). Images may be manipulated in Illustra by scaling,
enhancement, composition of images into a single image, and other image
analysis. Illustra also allows us to write our own C and C++ routines to extend
the functions and methods of the data types as well as to create new data
types. Illustra provides an ANSI SQL-92 query language interface closely
aligned with the emerging SQL-3 standard for object-oriented relational
database queries. Illustra's SQL support provides querying for all types
including natural data types like images. Illustra also provides the standard
features of a relational database system that we require: concurrency control,
data recovery from transaction failure, transaction control,  reports and
alerts to the supervisor of arbitrary database events, user authentication, and
automatic backups.
<p>
<b><a name="4">Challenges and Limitations. </a></b>Our implementation will need to
define the object-oriented data model, modify and extend the data types for the
multi-media demands of the ZfishDB, and create GUI interfaces to update and
query the Illustra databases. The existing WWW and ACeDB servers will continue
to provide some level of data support during the transition period.
