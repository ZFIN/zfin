You can find strains available through the Resource Center by searching <a href="/">ZFIN</a> 
  for <a href="/cgi-bin/ZFIN_jump?record=JUMPTOMUTANT">mutant</a> and <a href="/cgi-bin/ZFIN_jump?record=JUMPTOWILD">wild-type</a> 
  lines. You may also <a href="mailto:fish_requests@zfin.org">contact us</a> with 
  specific requests. </p>

<h3><br>Guidelines for obtaining fish</h3>
<ul>
  <p> 
  <p> 
  <li>We prefer to ship embryos because they travel better than adults, but for 
    some lines we may also be able to provide adult fish.We usually send 100-200 
    embryos but can send more if you make a special request. <a href="fees.html">Fees</a> 
    are listed on another page.</li>
  <p> 
  <li>We want each shipment to be successful. We typically ship 1-day old embryos 
    or fish early in the week to avoid travel during a weekend. You will be notified 
    of their expected time of arrival. Depending upon your location, you may need 
    to obtain special permissions, make customs arrangements, or pick up the package 
    at the airport or shipping service office. You should make these required 
    arrangements before requesting shipment. Please inform us of any problems 
    you have with the shipment. </li>
  <p> 
  <li>You should be ready to care for the fish, either embryos or adults, before 
    they are shipped. Larvae (after about 5 days) must be fed paramecia and then 
    baby brine shrimp for several weeks. Procedures for doing this are in <i>The 
    Zebrafish Book, A guide for the laboratory use of zebrafish (Danio rerio)</i>, 
    Monte Westerfield, ed. available <a href="/zf_info/zfbook/zfbk.html">on-line</a> 
    or you can order hard copies from Pat Edwards: <a href="mailto:edwards@uoneuro.uoregon.edu">edwards@uoneuro.uoregon.edu</a> 
    or (541) 346-5222. </li>
  <p> 
  <li>If you have not grown zebrafish before, you might want to practice before 
    we ship you fish. You can obtain detailed information on <a href="/zf_info/zfbook/cont.html#cont1">maintaining</a> 
    and <a href="/zf_info/zfbook/cont.html#cont2">breeding</a> adults and <a href="/zf_info/zfbook/cont.html#cont3">raising 
    babies</a> from the <i><a href="/zf_info/zfbook/zfbk.html">The Zebrafish Book</a>.</i> 
    We can then send you fish with some confidence of their being grown and maintained 
    properly.</li>
  <p> 
  <li>We encourage you to propagate the fish in your facility after you receive 
    them from us because the Zebrafish Resource Center still has a limited capacity 
    to fill orders.</li>
</ul>
