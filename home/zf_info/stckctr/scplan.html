  Research Activities and Design of the Zebrafish Resource Center</h3>
<B>Administration, operation, advertising, and reviews.</B> 
<P> <I>Administration and operation.</I> The Resource Center will be administered 
  by a Director with advisory help from the PIs and an external committee. The 
  Director will work under authority of the Vice Provost for Research. S/he will 
  act as the administrative/professional director of the activities of the Resource 
  Center. We propose three main areas of activity for the Resource Center which are 
  reflected in the three Specific Aims of this proposal: 1) obtaining, maintaining, 
  and distributing materials, 2) maintaining the database and communication with 
  the research community, and 3) conducting studies to improve fish health. The 
  Resource Center Director will oversee work in all three of these areas. S/he will 
  also be responsible for ensuring efficient operation of the Center and for directing 
  the activities of the personnel. The Director will maintain contacts with research 
  laboratories and will coordinate visits from scientists who wish to use the 
  Resource Center resources. The Administrative Specialist will be responsible for 
  communications and accounting. S/he will also help with database updates (see 
  below). <BR>
  <CENTER>
  </CENTER>
<P> a) Obtaining, maintaining, and distributing materials. The Director, with 
  help from the Administrative Specialist, will be responsible for contacting 
  laboratories (see ADVERTISING, below) to obtain and to distribute stocks. Several 
  people will be needed to maintain the lines in the Resource Center. In most zebrafish 
  research laboratories, individual workers maintain from 25-50 lines. Due to 
  the high efficiency we plan for the Resource Center, we anticipate maintaining 
  125 lines per person. Based on our poll of the zebrafish research community, 
  our initial goal is to maintain about 500 lines as live fish. Thus, a staff 
  of 4 research associates is required. 
<P> b) Maintaining the database and communication with the research community. 
  The database will need continuous updating to enter data as new mutations are 
  discovered, as additional genetic markers are mapped, and as new research publications 
  appear. The computer programmer/editor, with help from the administrative specialist, 
  will be responsible for overseeing these updates. Much of the updating will 
  be done directly by members of the research community, but in addition, the 
  computer programmer/editor will need to act as the database administrator to 
  ensure completeness of the data and to provide specialized services (e.g. non-standard 
  database searches). 
<P> c) Conducting studies to improve fish health. Dr. Kent will conduct the studies 
  of fish health. The research associates will help in these studies by identifying 
  potentially sick fish and by preparing tissue samples and cultures. 
<P> <I>Advertising.</I> We will use several vehicles to advertise stocks and materials 
  available from the Resource Center. The database will provide the most important 
  means for advertising. We anticipate that researchers will use the database 
  to learn about mutants and the various materials (e.g. antibodies, gene probes) 
  that can be used to identify and study them. The on-line database will allow 
  users to order directly from the Resource Center. Additionally, we will run advertisements 
  in each issue of <I>The Zebrafish Science Monitor </I>and an annual advertisement 
  in <I>Science.</I> The Resource Center will provide a listing at the biennial meeting 
  at Cold Spring Harbor of stocks and materials as well as ordering information. 
  We will also post a notice in the NIH Guide which has a large circulation and 
  has been used successfully by other resources to obtain business. Links between 
  the database, Net Vet, and the Animal Welfare Information Center, part of the 
  National Agricultural Library, will be included. 
<P> <I>Advisory committee and reviews.</I> The committee elected by the zebrafish 
  research community at the 1994 Cold Spring Harbor meeting, will initially serve 
  as an advisory committee and a review panel. This committee currently includes: 
  David Grunwald, Univ. of Utah; Marnie Halpern, Carnegie Inst.; Steve Wilson, 
  University College, London. The committee will meet (most commonly by email 
  or via conference phone calls) at the request of the Director to provide advice 
  for planning programmatic philosophy and direction. The committee will also 
  review the Resource Center annually and write a report on how it is meeting the 
  needs of the community. This report will be posted on the Fish Net WWW server 
  and will be mailed to the users via email. The committee will also present a 
  report at the biennial Cold Spring Harbor meeting and, at that meeting, solicit 
  suggestions for changes and improvements. In addition to this external group, 
  the PIs will serve as an internal advisory committee to help the director solve 
  major problems. The University of Oregon IACUC will oversee use of the facility 
  and review of animal care procedures with direction from the OVSAC. 
<P> <B>SPECIFIC AIM 1: To establish a resource center to serve as a central repository 
  for materials and information.</B> Our goal is to establish a facility to maintain 
  a collection of wild-type and mutant zebrafish and the materials required to 
  identify and study the mutations. We propose to provide the following animals 
  and materials: 
<UL>
  <LI><I>Adult fish - </I> to provide embryos for the next generation and sperm 
    for storage 
  <LI><I>Special purpose lines -</I> (e.g. double mutants) for genetic studies; 
    made by request 
  <LI><I>Frozen sperm -</I> safety backup; to maintain lines that are not kept 
    as live fish 
  <LI><I>Live embryos -</I> to provide the next generation; to identify mutant 
    carriers 
  <LI><I>Fixed embryos -</I> stored examples of mutant phenotypes 
  <LI><I>Antibodies, RNA probes -</I> to identify mutant carriers 
  <LI><I>DNA markers -</I> to identify mutant carriers, to map new markers 
  <LI><I>Reference cross DNAs -</I> to map mutations, cloned genes, ESTs 
</UL>
<B>Adult Fish:</B> We will receive wild-type fish and fish carrying mutant chromosomes 
from the research community. These fish will be housed in the Quarantine Room. 
Embryos will be generated either by outcrosses to wild-type strains (AB and TU) 
or by intercrosses between males and females from each line, depending upon their 
source (see INTERCROSSES, below). The embryos will be cleaned to remove pathogens, 
moved into the Nursery, grown to adulthood, and tested to ensure that we have 
recovered the line. Sperm from identified males will be frozen for long term storage.

Table 1. Methods for identifying homozygous and heterozygous carriers. 
<P> <I>Identifying mutant carriers for the next generation.</I> We will identify 
  fish carrying viable dominant or homozygous recessive mutations by examining 
  them directly for the mutant phenotype. We will identify heterozygous fish carrying 
  recessive mutations by examining their haploid or homozygous diploid offspring. 
  We will need to employ a variety of screening methods to identify the wide range 
  of mutations that have been discovered; the particular method will depend upon 
  the phenotype of the mutant (Table 1). Currently, most zebrafish mutations produce 
  visible morphological defects and act as recessive Mendelian genes (Mullins 
  et al., 1994; Solnica-Krezel et al., 1994), although other types of mutations 
  and transgenic chromosomes are also being identified (Henion et al., 1996; Fritz 
  et al., 1996; Gaiano and Hopkins, 1996). Our colleagues and we have developed 
  these screening methods; thus, we have extensive experience and will be able 
  to use them to identify all of the mutants to be maintained by the Resource Center. 
  In the future, new types of screens will undoubtedly be developed. When mutants 
  from these screens are submitted to the Resource Center, we will host visits from 
  the researchers who have developed these new methods so that the Resource Center 
  staff can learn how to identify the mutant carriers. 
<P> <IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC=crs1.gif> <I>Outcrosses.</I> To ensure that mutations 
  are present on a uniform and consistent genetic background and to maintain the 
  health and vigor of mutant lines, heterozygous fish will also be outcrossed 
  to the standard laboratory wild-type strains (e.g. AB and TU). This is especially 
  important for mutations that were generated from heavily ENU mutagenized fish 
  because they may harbor mutations in addition to the desired one. By outcrossing 
  for 10 generations, and always selecting for the desired mutation, these other 
  unwanted mutations will be eliminated. By alternately crossing to AB or TU wild-type 
  strains, healthy viable hybrid strains will be generated. The outcross stocks 
  will be derived from group matings rather than a cross of a single pair. Identified 
  heterozygous males will be used to generate sperm for freezing. 
<P> <IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC=crs2.gif> <I>Intercrosses.</I> Once mutations have been 
  stabilized in a strong wild-type background, we will maintain recessive lethal 
  mutations in heterozygotes. Viable mutations can be kept in either homozygous 
  or heterozygous form. To obtain maximal numbers of identified heterozygotes, 
  we will keep mutant working stocks as intercrosses between identified heterozygous 
  parents. In the case of recessive lethal mutations, the homozygous offspring 
  die, thus 2/3 of the survivors are heterozygous carriers. The progeny from several 
  intercrosses will be pooled to maximize the genetic diversity (hybrid vigor) 
  of the stock. To produce mutant embryos to send to researchers on request, we 
  will use identified fish from one generation while another generation of intercross 
  progeny are growing towards sexual maturity. On average, we will make a new 
  generation every 4 months. Each generation will be represented by at least 50 
  fish, or more for lines that are frequently requested. 
<P> Our initial goal is to maintain about 500 lines as live fish in tanks. This 
  number is close to that suggested from our poll of the research community who 
  requested that at least 1 allele for each locus (currently about 650) be kept 
  as live fish. Based upon the need for additional lines and our long-term need 
  to recover costs, we may be able to expand this number in the future; space 
  for 50-100% expansion of the number of tanks is included in the facility design. 
  All of these lines, as well as all other lines received by the Resource Center, 
  will also be kept as frozen sperm, both to save tank space and as a safety backup. 
  We will maintain a minimum of 10 sperm samples for every line. Based upon information 
  from the research community, we will maintain the 500 lines that are most frequently 
  requested as live fish. Requests for the other lines that are stored as frozen 
  sperm only will require thawing the sperm and reestablishing the line by in 
  vitro fertilization. Adults from these lines will be available for production 
  of mutant embryos in about 2-3 months. Identified males will be used to replenish 
  the frozen sperm stock, and depending upon the level of interest (assayed by 
  advertisement and email inquires), these reestablished lines will be maintained 
  as live fish or they will be euthanized. 
<P> <B>Embryos.</B> Mutant embryos, generated while identifying adult carriers, 
  will be sent to investigators who request them. To save time and effort, excess 
  mutant embryos will be fixed and stored for shipment to investigators who may 
  request them for histological, biochemical or molecular genetic analyses. This 
  library of mutant embryos, fixed at various developmental stages, will take 
  up little storage space and will provide an extremely important and efficient 
  source of materials for pilot studies. 
<P> <B>Antibodies, RNA probes, DNA markers.</B> These are standard reagents which 
  will be stored frozen and used to identify mutant carriers. These probes will 
  also be shipped to researchers on request. Many of the antibodies that recognize 
  zebrafish antigens have already been deposited in the Developmental Studies 
  Hybridoma Bank in Iowa City and, thus, will not need to be provided by the Resource 
  Center. 
<P> <B>Reference cross DNAs.</B> Reference crosses have been set up in Eugene 
  and in Boston (Knapik et al., 1996) to identify polymorphisms for mapping cloned 
  genes (Johnson et al., 1996). Other reference crosses will probably be made 
  in the near future. The DNA of individual offspring from these crosses are used 
  for PCR (Johnson et al., 1996). They are stored frozen and will be shipped upon 
  request. 
<P> <B>SPECIFIC AIM 2: To make information widely available to the research community. 
  </B>
<P><B>We will develop and maintain a computer database, 
  accessible over the Internet, of zebrafish information.</b> A major goal of 
  the proposed Resource Center is to integrate into a coherent database information 
  about zebrafish development, genetics, genomics, (see SPECIFIC AIM 1, above), 
  researchers, laboratories and publications. Design of a database for zebrafish 
  research information is already underway through the NSF funded scientific database 
  program and contributions from the W.M. Keck Foundation. The Resource Center will 
  provide an ideal site to maintain and extend this database which will contain: 
<UL>
  <LI><I>Image data: </I> morphology, anatomy, antibody staining patterns, gene 
    expression patterns, anatomical and developmental atlases, images of mutant 
    phenotypes. 
  <LI><I>Text data: </I> lists of zebrafish wild-type and mutant strains, phenotypic 
    descriptions, laboratory methods, information on DNA libraries and antibodies, 
    gene and protein sequences, addresses of researchers, complete list of zebrafish 
    research publications including abstracts and links to authors, newsletter, 
    general news. 
  <LI><I>Graphical/spatial data: </I> zebrafish genetic map, neuroanatomical and 
    morphological summary diagrams, physiological records. 
</UL
>
<P> The database is implemented through a WWW server, making it accessible for 
  searches over the Internet with standard WWW browsers. For example, mutants 
  can be found on the basis of their phenotypes, affected genes, map locations, 
  laboratory of origin, etc. (Westerfield et al., 1997). Links to sources of the 
  data will be provided. After completing a database search, the user will be 
  able to place an order on-line directly to the Resource Center. 
<P> <U>The database will provide a complete listing of stocks and materials maintained 
  by the Resource Center and an automatic means for placing orders. </U> 
<P> To ensure that the database is as complete as possible we will 1) enter data 
  from existing sources and 2) enter new data as it becomes available. Much of 
  the data will be entered directly by authorized users including information 
  on mutants, map markers, labels, images and physiological records. This will 
  reduce the work required by Resource Center personnel. Other information, including 
  records of people, laboratories, sources, cloned genes, and publications, will 
  be entered and updated by the database administrator based on email communications 
  with the scientific community, weekly GenBank and MEDLINE searches, and reading 
  new publications as they appear. The database will be reviewed annually for 
  design, data integrity, and effectiveness in serving the needs of the research 
  community by an international committee which has already been established. 
<P> <B>Relationship between ZFIN and the Resource Center database.</B> The ZFIN data 
  resource is distinct from and should not be confused with the stock tracking 
  database the Resource Center will require. Many laboratories use standard databases 
  to manage their fish breeding facilities and such a local database will also 
  be employed in the Resource Center. The goals of the ZFIN data resource are much 
  broader: it serves as a comprehensive, archival data resource for the entire 
  zebrafish research community; ZFIN integrates and make available the latest 
  information on known mutant lines, the zebrafish genetic map, images of mutants, 
  and information on researchers, labs, and publications. It does not deal with 
  stock tracking functions like listing which fish are currently in which tanks. 
  Although important for the Resource Center, this information is not relevant to 
  the global research community. 
<P> In the long run, we anticipate integrating the stock management database with 
  ZFIN. The two database functions would remain conceptually distinct, but would 
  be implemented within the same database system, allowing them to be tightly 
  integrated. For example, when displaying information for a mutant line, ZFIN 
  could simultaneously indicate whether the line is currently maintained at the 
  Resource Center, and allow the researcher viewing the record to order a sample 
  of that stock on-line. Similarly, Resource Center staff could be notified by 
  ZFIN of new developments (e.g., newly developed mutations, new publications 
  related to existing mutations, etc.), allowing them to manage the strains available 
  at the Resource Center more efficiently. 
<P> Integrating the ZFIN database project with a Resource Center would complement 
  timely, global dissemination of research results with instantaneous access to 
  genetic material. Moreover, centralizing both database functions in the Resource Center will allow data input, updates, etc. to be coordinated. 
<P> <B>We will foster an electronic network of communication among laboratories 
  using zebrafish.</B> The Resource Center will take over the email list of zebrafish 
  researchers, maintain and update it, and send out notices as necessary. The 
  Resource Center will use this list to field the many daily requests for information 
  . The Resource Center will moderate the USENET electronic bulletin board. The procedures 
  for maintaining these activities are already well established. 
<P> <B>We will publish a manual for the laboratory use of zebrafish and a periodical 
  with news about zebrafish research and techniques. The Resource Center will host 
  visits from researchers who wish to work with stocks, learn techniques, or learn 
  how to identify and maintain mutant stocks.</B> The Resource Center will take over 
  publication and distribution of the <I>Zebrafish Book: A manual for the laboratory 
  use of zebrafish, </I>and the periodical,<I> The Zebrafish Science Monitor.</I> 
  The Resource Center will maintain the subscription list, receive contributions 
  from the research community, and print and distribute new editions. The Resource Center will include, in each issue of the<I> Monitor,</I> advertisements of 
  the materials and services it provides. The Resource Center will host visitors 
  who wish to do research or learn techniques. The proposed facility includes 
  office and laboratory space for visiting researchers. The University rents small 
  apartments to visitors on a daily or weekly basis and there are many hotels 
  in the area that can house visitors. 
<P> <B>SPECIFIC AIM 3: To develop methods for improving health.</B> We will develop 
  and implement a set of standards to ensure zebrafish health. Specifically we 
  will 1) identify the major diseases affecting laboratory zebrafish, 2) develop 
  methods for disease control and treatment, and 3) prepare a manual on zebrafish 
  diseases. Our health standards will be based on the procedures we have already 
  developed including quarantine of all fish brought in from outside the Resource Center, the recirculating water system, and standardized methods for handling 
  fish. To detect diseases, we will examine fish with apparent pathologies. We 
  will also examine diseased fish we receive from other laboratories, and we will 
  conduct regular examinations of apparently normal fish from our stocks. Moribund 
  and dead fish will be necropsied, even when mortalities are minimal. Necropsy 
  procedures will follow our standard protocols (Kent 1992; Stoskopf 1993) and 
  will be conducted by the Fish Pathology Service. The history of the disease, 
  behavioral changes, and gross external pathological changes will be examined 
  and recorded. Moribund fish will be euthanized and wet mount preparations of 
  the gills and skin scrapings will be examined for external parasites or infections. 
  The abdominal cavity will be exposed by dissection, internal changes will be 
  noted, and squash preparations of internal tissues will be examined for pathological 
  changes and for parasites or other infections. 
<P> <B>We will identify the major diseases affecting laboratory zebrafish.</B> 
  We will conduct in-depth investigations to determine the sources and causes 
  of the important diseases that we identify. By determining which fish and which 
  tanks are infected, we will be able to identify the source of the disease (supplier, 
  strain, etc.). This is possible because the parallel water system and our standard 
  handling procedures will keep the infection contained allowing us to trace its 
  source. In addition to pathology and microbiology exams, we will conduct in 
  vivo transmission studies to learn whether transmission is vertical, horizontal, 
  or both. These studies will be conducted by the Salmon Disease Laboratory. We 
  will use cell culture and electron microscopic analysis of potential viral and 
  bacterial infections to elucidate the cause of the disease in question. For 
  example, we will conduct studies to determine the cause of the neurofibrosarcomas. 
  Schmale (1995) has shown that a retrovirus causes a common neurofibroma in another 
  aquarium fish, the bicolor damsel fish. We will investigate the potential role 
  of oncogenic viruses in zebrafish neoplasms using traditional methods (e.g., 
  transmission studies, cell culture, electron microscopy) as well as an RT PCR 
  test (Pyra et al. 1994), which we have recently adapted for analysis of fish 
  retroviruses (Kent et al. 1997). 
<P> 
<UL>
  <LI><I>Histopathology. </I> For histological examinations, fish will be fixed 
    and sectioned in our histology laboratory. Slides will be examined using our 
    standard procedures (Kent, 1990, 1992). 
  <LI><I>Bacteriology. </I>If a bacterial disease is suspected, bacteria inocula 
    will be obtained aseptically from the kidney and cultured. Bacterial identification 
    and antibiotic sensitivity tests will be performed in collaboration with the 
    Salmon Disease Laboratory at Oregon State University, which has extensive 
    experience with fish pathogens (Leong, 1995). 
  <LI><I>Virology.</I> Examinations for viral diseases will be done directly on 
    tissues using transmission electron microscopy of suspected organs. This will 
    be performed at the University's Electron Microscopy laboratory. Viruses will 
    be cultured and identified in collaboration with the Salmon Disease Laboratory 
    at Oregon State University. 
</UL>
<P> <B>We will develop methods for disease control and treatment.</B> After we 
  have determined the source and mode of transmission of an infectious disease, 
  we will develop a therapy. With consultation from the OVSAC veterinarian we 
  will use antibiotics and other chemotherapeutants as appropriate to control 
  infectious diseases we have identified. We will start with well-established 
  treatments already employed for similar pathogens of food fishes. Using efficacy 
  and toxicity trials, we will adapt them for zebrafish. We have extensive previous 
  experience developing efficacy studies (Kent and Dawe 1994; Higgins and Kent 
  1996). If established treatments are unavailable for fish, we will examine treatments 
  developed for other animals. For some diseases, we may find no therapeutically 
  beneficial treatments. In these cases, we will control the disease by early 
  identification, using the tests we have developed to characterize the disease, 
  and removal of affected fish. 
<P> <B>We will prepare a manual on zebrafish diseases.</B> We will focus on diseases 
  affecting laboratory populations of zebrafish. We will provide general sections 
  on management, disease treatment, and methods for preparing and shipping specimens 
  for disease analysis. In addition, we will describe and illustrate with color 
  photographs, the diseases of importance to zebrafish culture. For each specific 
  disease, we will include the following sections: general overview, gross pathology 
  and clinical signs, microscopic changes (e.g., histopathology), diagnosis, and 
  control and treatment. We have had experience preparing a similar manual for 
  diseases of fishes reared in sea water net pens (Kent, 1992).
