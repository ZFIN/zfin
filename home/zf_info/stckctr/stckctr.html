<P>The Zebrafish International Resource Center is <a 
href="/zf_info/stckctr/plans.html">housed</a>
   on the <a href="http://www.uoregon.edu/">University of Oregon</a> campus in
   <a href="http://www.ci.eugene.or.us/">Eugene</a>. Its mission is to provide
   a central repository for wild-type and mutant strains of zebrafish <i>(Danio
   rerio)</i> and for materials and information about zebrafish 
research. Materials
   and zebrafish strains are distributed to the research community. 
Pathology services
   are provided for diseased fish. Standards and procedures for 
maintaining healthy
   strains of zebrafish are being developed and a manual for 
prevention, diagnosis,
   and treatment of diseases affecting zebrafish is being prepared. <BR>
   &nbsp; </P>
<H3>Resources Provided</H3>
<P><I><a href="guide.html">Animals:</a></i> Healthy stocks of 
zebrafish and frozen
   sperm are maintained and distributed to the research community. 
Strains of wild-type
   fish and lines carrying mutations and transgenes are accepted from 
the research
   community, maintained, and distributed upon request. Embryos 
preserved in fixative
   at various developmental stages are available from these lines for 
histological,
   biochemical, or molecular biological studies. Researchers are 
welcome to visit
   the Resource Center to screen the collection for mutations of interest or to
   learn procedures.</P>
<P><I><a href="health.html">Animal health:</a></i>&nbsp; Advice about zebrafish
   health is provided. Diseased fish and tissue samples may be sent to 
the Resource
   Center for <a href="health.html">pathology analysis</a>. The Resource Center
   maintains <a href="dis_man/Fish_Diseases.html">The Manual on 
Zebrafish Diseases</a>
   that describes diseases of importance to laboratory zebrafish culture. </P>
<P><I><a href="guide.html">Biological materials:</a></i> Antibodies, 
gene probes,
   and other markers to analyze wild-type and mutant stocks as well as zebrafish
   cell lines are received, stored, and distributed. </P>
<P><I><a href="/zf_info/dbase/db.html">Informatics:</a></i>&nbsp; An 
on-line database,
   <a href="/ZFIN">ZFIN (http://zfin.org)</a>, of information about 
zebrafish research
   is maintained including information about zebrafish genetics, genomics, and
   development. Information about the resources and services provided 
by the Resource
   Center are available as well as a listing of zebrafish researchers, 
laboratories,
   and publications. ZFIN integrates information about the genetic map 
being generated
   by the zebrafish genome initiative and provides links to related information
   about genes in other species-specific databases. Researchers can use ZFIN to
   register and submit to the nomenclature committee new names for 
mutant alleles
   and for genes identified by molecular cloning. </P>
<P><i><a href="fees.html">Fees:</a> </i>Nominal fees are charged for 
these materials
   and services.</P>
<P><b>Acknowledging materials and services:</b> The Zebrafish International 
Resource
   Center is supported by grant #RR12546 from the NIH-NCRR. Please acknowledge
   the Zebrafish International Resource Center and this grant number 
in all publications
   resulting from the materials and/or services we are providing to you. Thank
   you.</P>
