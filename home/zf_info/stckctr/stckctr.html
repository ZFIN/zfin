<P>The Zebrafish International Resource Center is <a href="/zf_info/stckctr/plans.html">housed</a> 
  on the <a href="http://www.uoregon.edu/">University of Oregon</a> campus in 
  <a href="http://www.ci.eugene.or.us/">Eugene</a>. Its mission is to provide 
  a central repository for wild-type and mutant strains of zebrafish <i>(Danio 
  rerio)</i> and for materials and information about zebrafish research. Materials 
  and zebrafish strains are distributed to the research community. Pathology services 
  are provided for diseased fish. Standards and procedures for maintaining healthy 
  strains of zebrafish are being developed and a manual for prevention, diagnosis, 
  and treatment of diseases affecting zebrafish is being prepared. <BR>
  &nbsp; </P>
<H3>Resources Provided</H3>
<P><I><a href="guide.html">Animals:</a></i> Healthy stocks of zebrafish and frozen 
  sperm are maintained and distributed to the research community. Strains of wild-type 
  fish and lines carrying mutations and transgenes are accepted from the research 
  community, maintained, and distributed upon request. Embryos preserved in fixative 
  at various developmental stages are available from these lines for histological, 
  biochemical, or molecular biological studies. Researchers are welcome to visit 
  the Resource Center to screen the collection for mutations of interest or to 
  learn procedures. To submit fish or sperm or to order fish or embryos, email: 
  <a href="mailto:fish_requests@zfin.org">fish_requests@zfin.org</a></P>
<P><I><a href="health.html">Animal health:</a></i>&nbsp; Advice about zebrafish 
  health is provided. Diseased fish and tissue samples may be sent to the Resource 
  Center for <a href="health.html">pathology analysis</a>. </P>
<P><I><a href="guide.html">Biological materials:</a></i> Antibodies, gene probes, 
  and other markers to analyze wild-type and mutant stocks as well as zebrafish 
  cell lines are received, stored, and distributed. </P>
<P><I><a href="/zf_info/dbase/db.html">Informatics:</a></i>&nbsp; An on-line database, 
  <a href="/ZFIN">ZFIN (http://zfin.org)</a>, of information about 
  zebrafish research is maintained including information about zebrafish genetics, 
  genomics, and development. Information about the resources and services provided 
  by the Resource Center are available as well as a listing of zebrafish researchers, 
  laboratories, and publications. ZFIN integrates information about the genetic 
  map being generated by the zebrafish genome initiative and provides links to 
  related information about genes in other species-specific databases. Researchers 
  can use ZFIN to register and submit to the nomenclature committee new names 
  for mutant alleles and for genes identified by molecular cloning. </P>
<P><i><a href="fees.html">Fees:</a> </i>Nominal fees are charged for these materials 
  and services.</P>
