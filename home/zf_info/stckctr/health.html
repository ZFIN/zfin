<h3>Resource Center Pathology and Health Services:</h3>
<P>The Zebrafish International Resource Center provides diagnostic services and 
  health status testing for laboratory zebrafish. The histopathology services 
  can be utilized to analyze specific or suspected disease problems. Diagnostic 
  services include necropsy, bacteriology, and virology. Based upon clinical history 
  and test results, specific recommendations for control or treatment will be 
  provided. </P>
<P>The Resource Center can also provide routine sentinel or quality control testing 
  of zebrafish from healthy laboratory colonies (e.g. to fulfill institutional 
  animal care and use committe, IACUC, health status monitoring requirements).</P>
<P> Contact Jennifer Matthews, DVM, PhD, (Phone: (541) 346-6028 ext. 14 or Email: 
  <a href="mailto:fish_health@zfin.org">fish_health@zfin.org</a>) for information 
  about pathology and health services. DO NOT send fish before you have contacted 
  Dr. Matthews to receive instructions about <a href="/zf_info/stckctr/fix.html">preparing 
  specimens</a>. </P>
<P>To analyze an outbreak of an infectious disease, 5-7 diseased fish are typically 
  required. We provide a package rate for this service. In addition, suspected 
  neoplasias or other problems that may involve an individual fish are very interesting 
  to us, so please contact us even if you have only a single diseased fish. </P>

<b>Acknowledging materials and services:</b> The Zebrafish International Resource 
Center is supported by grant #RR12546 from the NIH-NCRR. Please acknowledge the 
Zebrafish International Resource Center and this grant number in all publications

Thank you.<br>
<h3> Resource Center Health Studies:</h3>
<P>The Resource Center Health Studies have three main aims:</P>
<P><b>1. Identify the major diseases affecting laboratory zebrafish</b>. A major 
  research goal of the Resource Center is to identify and characterize the diseases 
  and health problems present in laboratory colonies of zebrafish. We encourage 
  researchers to send us samples of diseased zebrafish. Our analysis of samples 
  from many laboratories will provide a broad survey of most diseases affecting 
  laboratory colonies. When a particular disease is identified, the source and 
  course of the disease will be investigated including <i>in vivo</i> transmission 
  studies.</P>
<P><b>2. Develop methods for disease control and treatment.</b> Methods of disease 
  control are established initially by adapting known treatments for similar diseases 
  in other fish or animal species. The treatments are adapted using efficacy and 
  toxicity trials.</P>
<P><b>3. Prepare a manual on zebrafish diseases.</b> The diseases of importance 
  to laboratory zebrafish culture are being described and illustrated. For each 
  disease, the following is included: general overview of the disease, gross pathology 
  and clinical signs, microscopic changes (e.g. histopathology), and control and 
  treatment. </P>
