<h3><B>OVERVIEW</B> </h3>
<P> Zebrafish has emerged recently as a premiere organism to study vertebrate 
  development and genetics. Powerful techniques allow efficient generation and 
  recovery of zebrafish mutations affecting genes that regulate developmental 
  patterning, organogenesis, physiology and behavior. The functions of many of 
  these genes are conserved among vertebrate groups. Thus, analysis of zebrafish 
  mutations provides insights into gene functions in other vertebrates, including 
  humans. 
<P> Ongoing genetic screens have identified over 7,000 mutations; fish that carry 
  them are distributed among more than 100 laboratories in 28 countries. The zebrafish 
  research community desperately needs a centralized facility to preserve and 
  track these stocks and to facilitate their distribution to researchers. 
<P> Recently, a small group of representatives of the zebrafish research community 
  obtained funds to establish an International Resource Center for Zebrafish on 
  the University of Oregon campus. These include money from the State of Oregon 
  for construction of a new building and a grant from the NIH (P40 RR12546) for 
  equipment, supplies and operating expenses. An application to the NIH for additional 
  construction money is pending review. 
<P> The Resource Center will have three main functions: 1) It will maintain and 
  make available to the research community wild-type and mutant zebrafish stocks, 
  frozen sperm, and reagents. It will organize genetic markers and maintain the 
  genetic map. 2) The Resource Center will distribute information. It will maintain 
  the ZFIN computer database, accessible via the Internet, publish a manual for 
  the laboratory use of zebrafish, facilitate communication among zebrafish researchers, 
  and host visits from researchers to work with stocks or learn techniques to 
  identify and maintain mutants. 3) The Resource Center will develop methods to 
  improve zebrafish health. It will establish standards and procedures for generating 
  and maintaining healthier more vigorous strains, characterize endemic diseases, 
  develop methods for disease control and treatment, and publish a manual of procedures 
  for preventing, diagnosing, and treating zebrafish diseases. 
<h3> <B>SPECIFIC AIMS</B> </h3>
<P> The last several years have witnessed an explosion in our understanding of 
  vertebrate development, largely based on work from a few model genetic organisms. 
  The zebrafish is the newest of these model organisms. Because the basic principles 
  of body patterning appear similar during embryogenesis of all vertebrates, insights 
  gained from work on embryonic zebrafish will have implications for human health 
  and disease. Moreover, research on this organism meets the intent of the Animal 
  Welfare Act because use of many higher vertebrates can now be replaced by use 
  of this lower vertebrate. 
<P> Systematic genetic research on zebrafish began at the University of Oregon 
  and for many years Eugene was the only place it was performed. Recently, however, 
  international interest in this organism has grown tremendously (Balter, 1995; 
  Eisen, 1996; Travis, 1996); studies of the embryology and genetics of zebrafish 
  and the recent identification of over 7,000 genetic mutations have led to a 
  dramatic increase in the number of laboratories using this organism to study 
  the basic mechanisms of vertebrate development. Currently these genetic stocks 
  are distributed among more than 100 laboratories in 28 countries. To make room 
  for new mutants, laboratories must discontinue some of their current stocks 
  many of which are permanently lost. The zebrafish research community desperately 
  needs a centralized site to preserve and keep track of these stocks and to facilitate 
  their distribution to researchers, thus supporting and promoting research opportunities 
  while preventing duplication of effort. 
<P> We will construct a facility to maintain wild-type and mutant stocks of zebrafish 
  and to make these stocks widely available to the international research community. 
  A Resource Center is needed because it can eliminate the requirement of individual 
  laboratories to maintain stocks they are unable to study, it can provide animals 
  at lower cost than individual laboratories, and most importantly, it can ensure 
  the highest possible levels of quality and uniformity. Specifically we will: 
<P> <B>1. Establish a Resource Center to serve as a central repository for materials 
  and information.</B> We will maintain healthy stocks of fish and frozen sperm 
  of identified genotypes and make them widely available to the research community. 
  We will obtain carriers of mutations from the research community and breed them 
  to produce new generations. We will freeze and store sperm from these carriers. 
  We will receive and store antibodies, gene probes, and markers used to identify 
  and analyze wild-type and mutant stocks. We will receive and organize genetic 
  markers and maintain the genetic map. Upon request we will ship these materials 
  to research laboratories throughout the world. 
<P> <B>2. Make information widely available to the research community.</B> We 
  will develop and maintain a computer database, accessible via the WWW of the 
  Internet, of information about the stocks. Additionally, the database will provide 
  information about the genetic map, markers, molecular probes, laboratory methods, 
  developmental staging, embryonic and adult anatomy, and gene expression patterns. 
  Electronic links to researchers, laboratories, sources, and publications will 
  be provided through WWW services. We will foster an electronic network of communication 
  among laboratories using zebrafish. We will publish both hardcopy and electronic 
  versions of a manual for the laboratory use of zebrafish and a periodical with 
  news about zebrafish research and techniques. The Resource Center will host 
  visits from researchers who wish to work with stocks, learn techniques, or learn 
  to identify and maintain mutant stocks. 
<P> <B>3. Develop methods for improving health.</B> We will establish standards 
  and procedures for generating and maintaining healthier and more vigorous strains. 
  We will characterize diseases endemic to laboratory stocks. We will study these 
  diseases to identify their sources and causes and we will develop methods for 
  their control and treatment. We will publish a manual for the prevention, diagnosis, 
  and treatment of diseases affecting zebrafish.
