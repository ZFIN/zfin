<h3><B>OVERVIEW</B> </h3>
<P> Zebrafish <i>(Danio rerio)</i> has emerged recently as a premiere organism 
  to study vertebrate development and genetics. Powerful techniques allow efficient 
  generation and recovery of zebrafish mutations. Ongoing genetic screens have 
  identified over 7,000 mutations in zebrafish affecting genes that regulate developmental 
  patterning, organogenesis, physiology and behavior. The functions of many of 
  these genes are conserved among vertebrate groups. Thus, analysis of zebrafish 
  mutations provides insights into gene functions in other vertebrates, including 
  humans. 
<P>The mission of the Zebrafish International Resource Center is to provide a 
  central repository for wild-type and mutant strains of zebrafish and for materials 
  and information about zebrafish research. Materials and zebrafish strains are 
  distributed to the research community. Pathology services are provided for diseased 
  fish. Standards and procedures for maintaining healthy strains of zebrafish 
  are being developed and a manual for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of 
  diseases affecting zebrafish is being prepared. 
<P> Recently, a small group of representatives of the zebrafish research community 
  obtained funds to establish an International Resource Center for Zebrafish on 
  the University of Oregon campus. These include money from the State of Oregon 
  for construction of a new building and granst from the NIH construction (C06 
  RR13540) and for equipment, supplies and operating expenses (P40 RR12546).
<P> The Resource Center has three main functions: 1) It maintains and makes available 
  to the research community wild-type and mutant zebrafish stocks, frozen sperm, 
  and reagents. It organizes genetic markers and maintains the genetic map. 2) 
  The Resource Center distributes information. It maintains the ZFIN computer 
  database, accessible via the Internet, publishes a manual for the laboratory 
  use of zebrafish, facilitates communication among zebrafish researchers, and 
  hosts visits from researchers to work with stocks or learn techniques to identify 
  and maintain mutants. 3) The Resource Center develops methods to improve zebrafish 
  health. It establishes standards and procedures for generating and maintaining 
  healthier more vigorous strains, characterizes endemic diseases, develops methods 
  for disease control and treatment, and publishes a manual of procedures for 
  preventing, diagnosing, and treating zebrafish diseases. 
<h3> <B>SPECIFIC AIMS</B> </h3>
<P> The last several years have witnessed an explosion in our understanding of 
  vertebrate development, largely based on work from a few model genetic organisms. 
  The zebrafish is the newest of these model organisms. Because the basic principles 
  of body patterning appear similar during embryogenesis of all vertebrates, insights 
  gained from work on embryonic zebrafish has implications for human health and 
  disease. Moreover, research on this organism meets the intent of the Animal 
  Welfare Act because use of many higher vertebrates can now be replaced by use 
  of this lower vertebrate. 
<P> Systematic genetic research on zebrafish began at the University of Oregon 
  and for many years Eugene was the only place it was performed. Recently, however, 
  international interest in this organism has grown tremendously (Balter, 1995; 
  Eisen, 1996; Travis, 1996); studies of the embryology and genetics of zebrafish 
  and the recent identification of over 7,000 genetic mutations have led to a 
  dramatic increase in the number of laboratories using this organism to study 
  the basic mechanisms of vertebrate development. Until recently these genetic 
  stocks were distributed among more than 100 laboratories in 28 countries. To 
  make room for new mutants, laboratories must discontinue some of their current 
  stocks many of which are permanently lost. The zebrafish research community 
  desperately needed a centralized site to preserve and keep track of these stocks 
  and to facilitate their distribution to researchers, thus supporting and promoting 
  research opportunities while preventing duplication of effort. 
<P> The Zebrafish International Resource Center is a facility to maintain wild-type 
  and mutant stocks of zebrafish and to make these stocks widely available to 
  the international research community. The Resource Center reduces the requirement 
  of individual laboratories to maintain stocks they are unable to study, it can 
  provide animals at lower cost than individual laboratories, and most importantly, 
  it can ensure the highest possible levels of quality and uniformity. Specifically 
  we will: 
<P> <B>1. Establish a Resource Center to serve as a central repository for materials 
  and information.</B> The Resource Center maintains healthy stocks of fish and 
  frozen sperm of identified genotypes and makes them widely available to the 
  research community. The Resource Center obtains carriers of mutations from the 
  research community and breeds them to produce new generations. The Center freezes 
  and stores sperm from these carriers. It receives and stores antibodies, gene 
  probes, and markers used to identify and analyze wild-type and mutant stocks. 
  It receives and organizes genetic markers and maintains the genetic map. Upon 
  request the Resource Center will ship these materials to research laboratories 
  throughout the world. 
<P> <B>2. Make information widely available to the research community.</B> The 
  Resource Center maintains a computer database, accessible via the WWW of the 
  Internet, of information about the stocks. Additionally, the database provides 
  information about the genetic map, markers, molecular probes, laboratory methods, 
  developmental staging, embryonic and adult anatomy, and gene expression patterns. 
  Electronic links to researchers, laboratories, sources, and publications are 
  provided through WWW services. The Resource Center fosters an electronic network 
  of communication among laboratories using zebrafish. It publishes both hardcopy 
  and electronic versions of a manual for the laboratory use of zebrafish and 
  a periodical with news about zebrafish research and techniques. The Resource 
  Center hosts visits from researchers who wish to work with stocks, learn techniques, 
  or learn to identify and maintain mutant stocks. 
<P> <B>3. Develop methods for improving health.</B> The Resource Center establishes 
  standards and procedures for generating and maintaining healthier and more vigorous 
  strains. It characterizes diseases endemic to laboratory stocks. The Resource 
  Centerl studies these diseases to identify their sources and causes and develops 
  methods for their control and treatment. The Resource Center publishes a manual 
  for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases affecting zebrafish.
