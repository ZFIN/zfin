<p align="left"></font></b><b><font size="5" face="Albertus Medium">T</font></b><font FACE="Arial">he last several years have witnessed an explosion in our understanding of
vertebrate development, largely based on work from a few model genetic
organisms. The embryonic zebrafish is one of these new models, and many research
grants are funded by NIH and NIEHS to utilize this model. Studies of the
embryology and genetics of zebrafish and the recent identification of over 4,000
genetic mutations have lead to this dramatic increase in the number of
laboratories (now about 250) using zebrafish to study the basic mechanisms of
vertebrate development. In support of these endeavors, the Zebrafish
International Resource Center (ZIRC) was established at the University of Oregon
in 1998.</p>
<p>Although zebrafish have become an extremely important research model,
relatively little is known about the diseases that affect this species when held
in captivity. Indeed, severe health problems in zebrafish research colonies
could seriously jeopardize many millions of dollars in research, and some
researcher’s facilities have experienced devastating, acute mortalities in
their zebrafish colonies. Moreover, persistent, but less severe, infections have
plagued several facilities. As with other laboratory animals used in research,
it is imperative to conduct studies with disease-free, healthy zebrafish. Unlike
rodent models, where there are many certified specific pathogen free (SPF)
strains, we have just begun to develop SPF stocks of zebrafish. To aid in this
endeavor, we are developing sensitive diagnostic tests for the serious
pathogens.</p>
<p>The purpose of this manual is to provide an overview of the common diseases
of zebrafish as they occur in research facilities. For each disease, we provide
information on the characteristics (e.g., pathological presentation), methods
for diagnosis, and suggestions for control and treatment. In addition, methods
for conducting disease investigations and for collecting and shipping samples to
a diagnostic laboratory for further analysis are included. For additional
information about zebrafish disease research and our <a href="http://zfin.org/zf_info/stckctr/health.html"> diagnostic service</a>.</font><b></p>

<p>The small size of zebrafish present some unique challenges, and at the same
time advantages for conducting necropsies and other diagnostic tests. Our
knowledge of the diseases of zebrafish is relatively limited compared to those
of food fishes reared in aquaculture. Until recently, most diseases of zebrafish
that have been documented are those that are common problems in ornamental
freshwater fishes (e.g., <i>Piscinoodinium</i>). With other fish species, it
was not until they were recognized as commercially important and reared in
captivity in large numbers did specific diseases become recognized.</p>
<p>Viral diseases are often devastating in aquaculture enterprises. However, as
many viruses are very host specific, they are usually first identified only when
a fish species is reared in large numbers in captivity. Identification of
&quot;new&quot; viral diseases in fishes often requires establishment of new
cell lines from the host under investigation. At present, viruses are not
recognized as causes of disease in zebrafish, and thus zebrafish are not
routinely examined for viruses. However, zebrafish cell lines are available.</p>
<p>Likewise, with bacterial infections, aside from mycobacteriosis, only common,
opportunistic Gram negative bacteria such as <i>Aeromonas hydrophila</i> and
surface infections by gliding bacteria are occasionally encountered. Given the
above, our primary approach for diagnostics has been histopathology. This allows
for interpretation of pathological changes at the tissue and cell level.
Moreover, the small size of zebrafish allows for preparation of the entire fish
on one slide.</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2"><b>&nbsp;</b></font>The mere presence of a pathogen in a sick fish does not necessarily mean that
it is the cause of the disease. It is important, therefore, to conduct a
thorough investigation, beyond just detecting the presence or absence of known
pathogens, to determine the cause of the disease. Histological examinations, in
addition to gross necropsies and <i>in vitro</i> culture of microorganisms, are
often required to determine the association of the observed pathogens in the
disease being investigated.</p>
<p>Diagnosis of a disease begins at the research facility. Some of the most
crucial data are collected by the staff maintaining the fish by thorough record
keeping and careful observations of affected fish. The following information is
important for disease diagnosis and implementing control strategies. <a href="#Astrofsky 2002"> Astrofsky
et al. (2002)</a> recently published a guide for conducting clinical investigations
on laboratory zebrafish.</p>
<b>
<h4><a name="History">History</a></h4>
<p></b>To assist with obtaining an accurate diagnosis, the following information
should be obtained: origin (stock and strain), previous disease problems in the
affected population, and husbandry conditions (e.g., water hardness, diet,
medication history, system design, and mortality rate).</p>
<b>
<h4><a name="Behavior">Behavior</a></h4>
</b>
<p>Fish behavior may be useful for indication of an emerging disease and some
behavioral changes are useful for presumptive diagnoses. For example, if fish
are flashing (rubbing on the sides of tanks), this may indicate that they are
infected with external parasites. Other indications of disease include cessation
of feeding, lethargy, and abnormal position in the aquarium (e.g., at surface or
at the bottom). Abnormal respiratory pattern may indicate gill damage, and
whirling or spiraling swimming often indicates neurological damage.</p>
</font>
<b><font FACE="Arial">
<p><a name="Selecting Fish for Necropsy">Selecting Fish for Necropsy</a></p>
</font></b><font FACE="Arial">
<p>Examinations should be conducted on diseased fish that are collected while
still alive (moribund). It is important to determine the primary cause of
mortality and to differentiate this from secondary or opportunistic pathogens
that may have taken advantage of already diseased fish. To accomplish this,
several affected fish should be examined whenever possible. It is also useful to
include apparently normal, asymptomatic fish so that early pathological changes
and the underlying cause of morbidity can be determined. Dead fish may be
suitable for some parasitological examinations and for observing obvious
macroscopic pathological changes. However, bacteriological examinations
conducted on dead fish can yield misleading results, and many histological
changes are obliterated by post-mortem autolysis.</p>
<b>
<p><a name="External Examination">External Examination</a></p>
</b>
<p>The small size of zebrafish makes conducting a necropsy somewhat tedious, but
with patience and practice this can be efficiently accomplished with the aid of
a stereo dissecting microscope. Note surface abnormalities (e.g., frayed fins,
cloudy eyes, ulcers, skin discolorations, parasites, and tumors). Prepare wet
mounts of the skin mucus and a few scales by scraping the surface of the fish
with a coverslip and placing the coverslip on a glass slide. Some water may be
added to the preparation so that the area between the slide and the coverslip is
completely filled with liquid. Examine the wet mount with a compound microscope,
starting with low power. Reducing the light and lowering the condenser will
produce higher contrast, which will make microscopic parasites and other
pathogens more visible.</p>
<b>
<p><a name="Gills">Gills</a></b></p>
<p>Remove the operculum. Note color of gills (pale gills usually indicate
anemia). Check for parasites, cysts, excessive mucus, and hemorrhages with a
dissecting microscope. Prepare a wet mount by removing a few filaments with
scissors, placing the filaments in a large drop of freshwater on a glass slide,
and overlaying with a coverslip. Examine for small parasites, fungi, and
bacteria using a compound microscope.</p>
<b>
<p><a name="Internal Examination">Internal Examination</a></b></p>
<p>Open the visceral cavity. Note if ascites, hemorrhages or other abnormalities
are present. Expose the kidney by removing the swim bladder and note any kidney
abnormalities. Many diseases cause enlargement or discoloration of the kidney,
but this may be difficult to see in zebrafish due to their small size. Examine
the heart for any abnormalities. Multiple, whitish cysts in the visceral organs
is suggestive of <i>Mycobacterium</i> infections. Examine squash preparations of
organs with a compound microscope to detect encysted parasites, fungi or
granulomas. Squash preparations are made by removing a small piece of tissue,
and gently squashing it between a slide and coverslip so that a thin preparation
suitable for examination with a compound microscope or dissecting microscope is
made.</p>

<p><a href="#Leishman’s Giemsa Stain">Leishman's Giemsa</a> or Diff-Quik (<a href="http://www.dadebehring.com/">Dade Behring AG, Newark, DE</a>)
stained imprints of kidney, or other affected organs are useful for detection of
protozoa and bacteria. Remove a piece of tissue, blot on clean paper towel to
remove most of the blood, and lightly touch the cut surface of the tissue on a
clean glass slide. Several imprints from the same piece of tissue can be made on
one slide. Air dry the preparation for approximately 1/2 h. Fix the slide for
5-10 min in absolute methanol for Giemsa stains or the fixative provided with
the Dif-Quik kit. The slide can then be stained with Giemsa or Diff-Quik, or
shipped to a diagnostic laboratory. For <i>Mycobacterium</i>, imprints and
tissue smears are stained with acid fast stains. </font></p>
<p><font FACE="Arial"><b><a name="Histology">Histology</a></b></p>
<p>It is critical to fix fish for histology as soon as possible after fish are
killed to avoid post-mortem changes. If possible, do not use dead fish because
significant autolytic changes may occur in 15-20 min after death. Fish are
preserved in formaldehyde based fixative such as <a href="#Davidson's solution"> Davidson’s</a> or
<a href="#Dietrich’s Fixative"> Dietrich’s</a>
solutions for histology. Open the visceral cavity of the fish by
cutting and removing a small section of the abdominal wall. Then place fish
whole in the fixative at approximately 1:20 (v/v) tissue to fixative. We have
found Dietrich’s or Davidson's solution to be the best all around fixative for
processing whole zebrafish for histological examination. The entire fish can be
processed (usually cut in sagittal sections) and representative organs can be
visualized in multiple sections on one or two slides.</p>
<p><b><a name="Electron Microscopy">Electron Microscopy</a></b></p>
<p>Under special circumstances, electron microscopical examinations may be
warranted<b>. </b>The general principles for histology applies for collecting
specimens for electron microscopy, but freshness of tissues at fixation and
proper infiltration of tissues is even more critical. Therefore, small pieces of
tissue should be minced in cold glutaraldehyde based fixative into pieces about
2 mm<sup>3</sup> maximum. The fixed tissue is stored overnight in this solution,
then transferred to the appropriate buffer solution. Samples in EM fixatives and
buffers should be refrigerated. There are many EM fixatives and buffers. The
Appendix provides a recipes for Millonig’s buffer and fixative. Transmission
electron microscopy can be performed with limited success on tissues fixed in
neutral buffered formalin, but is very poor with acidic fixatives, such as
Davidson's or Dietrich’s solutions.</p>
<b>
<p><a name="Bacteriology">Bacteriology</a></p>
</b>
<p>Some bacterial infections, such as surface gliding bacteria and <i>Mycobacterium
</i>spp<i>.</i>, can be identified by simple Gram or acid fast stains (e.g.,
Ziehl Neelsen). However, the diagnosis of other bacterial diseases requires
isolation of the bacteria in culture. In this case, live fish should be
delivered to the laboratory, but this may not be practical in some situations.
For this reason, methods for obtaining initial cultures are provided below. The
bacterial cultures can then be sent to a laboratory for complete identification.</p>
<p>Use only freshly sacrificed fish for bacteriological examinations as dead
fish from the tanks are essentially worthless. Disinfect the surface of the fish
with 70 % ethanol. Flame-sterilize the dissecting instruments. Two methods are
used for obtaining inocula from the kidney. For the visceral method, open the
visceral cavity by making an incision in abdominal wall. Make sure not to cut
into the gastrointestinal tract. Then push aside the swim bladder with
flame-sterilized forceps and insert a sterile swab or loop into the kidney. For
the dorsal method, enter the kidney by lateral incision dorsal to the kidney
(i.e., near the lateral line). Streak the specimen on Tryptic Soy Agar or blood
agar bacteriological plates, seal the plates, keep at a room temperature, and
send the plates to the microbiology laboratory for further diagnosis.</p>
<p>For gliding bacteria (<i>Cytophaga</i>, <i>Flexibacter</i> and <i>Flavobacterium</i>
spp.), we recommend <i><a href="#Cytophaga Medium (for Gliding Bacteria)">Cytophaga</a></i> <a href="#Cytophaga Medium (for Gliding Bacteria)"> Medium</a>. Although the lesions
may exhibit massive numbers of gliding bacteria, other bacteria (e.g., <i>Aeromonas</i>
spp.) may overgrow the former. Therefore, the best way to obtain pure cultures
of gliding bacteria is to homogenize the infected tissue (e.g., gills, skin and
muscle) in sterile water, and inoculate plates in serial log dilutions.</p>
<p>Gram-stained preparations may reveal bacteria when they are numerous in
infected tissue. Smear or imprint suspect tissues thinly on a glass slide, air
dry and fix the slide by gently heating the slide over an open flame for 3-5
seconds. Gram stain kits are available from scientific supply houses and include
instructions for their use.</p>
<b>
<p><a name="Virology">Virology</a></p>
</b>
<p>As with bacterial diseases, isolation of viruses in culture may be required
to diagnose a viral disease, and culture is best conducted on tissues collected
from freshly killed fish. If this is not practical, the fish should be
refrigerated for no longer than 24 h before examination. As a last resort, fish
for virus examination can be frozen. The specimens are then transported to a
qualified fish virology laboratory. At present, there are no known viral
diseases of zebrafish colonies. However, as has been the case with other
relatively new forms of fish culture, as fish health researchers thoroughly
investigate outbreaks and incorporate tissue culture in their examinations, it
is very likely that &quot;new&quot; viral diseases will be recognized in
zebrafish.</p>
<p><b><a name="Molecular Biology">Molecular Biology</a></b></p>
<p>DNA-based diagnostic tests utilizing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are
becoming increasingly common in fish health diagnostics because they are very
sensitive and specific. With zebrafish, we have developed a PCR test for the
neural microsporidian <i>Pseudoloma neurophilia, </i>and <a href="#Astrofsky 2000"> Astrosky et al. (2000)</a>
used PCR tests to identify and differentiate different species of <i>Mycobacterium</i>.
Because of the extreme sensitivity with PCR, great care should be taken to avoid
cross contamination between samples. Bleach instruments between samples. Samples are either frozen immediately or preserved in ethanol. Mixed results
are achieved when using formalin preserved tissues for genotypic analysis. <a href="#BioTechniques 32: 296-298"> Moore
et al. (2001)</a> found that decalcification procedures, which are routinely used
when processing zebrafish for histology, are particularly detrimental for
molecular analyses.</p>
<p><b><a name="Transport of Specimens">Transport of Specimens</a></b></p>
<p>It is important that you contact the diagnostic laboratory prior to shipping live fish. If possible, food should be withheld from fish for 24 hours prior
to packaging and shipping. The water used for shipping should be held separate
from the fish before packaging. Sodium chloride can be added to the shipping
water at a rate of 2 ppt (2.0 g NaCl per liter water) to help reduce osmotic
stress. Fill shipping bags 1/3 full of clean water and gently place fish into
the bag. The
</font>
bag should be sealed such that an approximate ratio of 1/3 water, 2/3 <font FACE="Arial">air
is maintained. Bags are typically sealed by twisting the top and then folding
the twisted end over and securing it onto itself with a rubber band. The bag is
then placed within a second bag and sealed in the same manner. Place the bag in
an insulated shipping container. Live specimens should be shipped early in the
week to ensure arrival and adequate processing time.</p>
<p>It is not always possible to obtain live or fresh specimens. If only dead
fish can be provided for laboratory examination, they should be refrigerated and
examined within 24 h. If fish cannot be delivered to a laboratory within 24 h,
then fish should be preserved by fixation in tissue preservatives for histology
unless otherwise indicated. Each method of preservation has certain advantages
and disadvantages, as indicated in following table.</p>
<i>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Transport of Tissues in Fixative</b></i><b>.</b> For shipment of preserved fish, replace
fixative with 70% alcohol and soak overnight. Drain off excessive fluids, wrap
tissues in alcohol-soaked paper towels, and seal in a leak-proof container.</p>
<i>
<p><b>Transport of Frozen Fish</b></i><b>.</b> Freeze fish in a plastic bag and ship in an
insulated container with ice packs.</p>

<p>Chronic, systemic bacterial infections by certain acid-fast bacteria are
common in aquarium fishes, and the disease is often referred to as fish
tuberculosis. Several species in the genus <i>Mycobacterium</i> have been
associated with disease in fishes, including <i>M. marinum, M. abscessus</i> (=
M. <i>chelonae</i> subsp. <i>abscessus</i>), and <i>M. fortuitum</i>. Usually
the disease is chronic with low level mortality, but in certain circumstances,
infections may be very acute and result in massive epizootics in zebrafish
colonies. Factors that are most responsible for the differences seen in the
severity of outbreaks in fish TB have yet to be determined. It is not know if
highly virulent strains or species (e.g., <i>M.</i> <i>fortuitum</i>) cause the
acute outbreaks, or if the outbreaks occur in fish that are immunocompromised by
other factors, such at poor water quality, excessive crowding, etc.</p>
<p><i>Mycobacterium</i> spp. of fishes can infect humans. In most cases, the
infections are confined to the extremities, and though not usually
life-threatening may require aggressive antibiotic treatments to resolve (<a href="#Kern">Kern
et al. 1989</a>; <a href="#Shih"> Shih et al. 1997</a>; <a href="#Hoven 1998"> Hoyen et al.
1998</a>). However, these infections may
be lethal to immune compromised individuals (<a href="#Lessing">Lessing et al.
1993</a>). Considering
the zoonotic potential of <i>Mycobacterium</i> spp. from fishes, those handling
aquarium fishes, including zebrafish, should wash their hands after coming in
contact with water containing fish, and avoid exposing open lesions to aquarium
water and fishes.</p>
<b>
<p>Clinical Signs and Gross Pathology. </b>Clinical and macroscopic changes
associated with <i>Mycobacterium</i> may be variable, dependent upon the site
and extent of the infection, and on the &quot;chronicity&quot; of the infection.
Clinical signs include lethargy, anorexia, and emaciation. Fish may exhibit
ulcers, hemorrhage or hyperemia around the head (similar to Gram negative
septemicas), raised scales, frayed fins, and palor of the skin or gills. A
hallmark macroscopic change is the presence of multiple, white nodules in
various visceral organs. These are visible by close examination of organs with a
dissecting microscope, but may be hard to find in small fish, such as zebrafish.</p>
<p><a href="#Astrofsky 2000">Astrosky et al. (2000)</a> recently described various forms of the disease as
they occur in zebrafish. Infected fish showed decreased overall reproductive
capabilities, as well as characteristic changes such as dropsy (generalized
edema with swollen abdomens) and frank ulcers of the skin.</p>

histological examination reveals numerous granulomas, often with necrotic

tissues with an acid-fast stain (e.g., Ziehl-Neelsen) will often reveal acid

<p>Diagnosis</font></b><font FACE="Arial">. Preliminary diagnosis is achieved by
observing multiple granulomas in visceral organs in either wet mounts or
histological sections. These may also be cause by fungal or parasitic
infections. Confirmatory diagnosis is requires visualization of acid fast
bacilli in either histological sections or in tissue imprints. Some <i>Mycobacterium</i>
species are relatively difficult to grow in culture, and thus this procedure is
infrequently employed with fish. PCR tests for screening for the presence of the
causative agent have been described (<a href="#Colorni">Colorni et al. 1994</a>;
<a href="#Astrofsky 2000"> Astrofsky et al. 2000</a>). Such tests, while extremely sensitive, usually do not provide information
on disease status or the severity of infection, but may be useful for screening
for carrier/subclinical infections.</p>
<b>
<p>Control and Treatment</b>. The infection is usually very difficult to
eradicate in fish culture systems with antibiotics. However, <a href="#Conroy"> Conroy and Conroy
(1999)</a> reported that kanamycin at 50 ppm with 4 doses 2 days apart apparently
controlled the disease in guppies. <a href="#Boos"> Boos et al. (1995)</a> treated firemouth cichlids
and Congo tetras orally with rifampicin and tetracycline with some success.
Nevertheless, depopulation of affected tanks and avoiding cross contamination
has been the most effective way for controlling the infection in aquarium fishes
(<a href="#Astrofsky 2000">Astrofsky et al. 2000</a>).</p>
<p>Because the disease is rather insidious, the infection is wide spread in
aquarium fishes, and treatment with antibiotics is difficult, the best approach
is to avoid the infection. This is accomplished by strict quarantine procedures
and understanding a thorough history of the stocks introduced into research
facilities. In addition, optimizing water quality and husbandry conditions will
reduce the likelihood of epizootics occurring when a few carry fish are present
in the population.</p>

</b>
<p>Several species of gliding bacteria (i.e., <i>Flavobacterium, Flexibacter</i>
or <i>Cytophaga</i> spp.) caused surface infections in freshwater and marine
fishes. One of these diseases, bacterial gill disease (BGD), is an infection
caused by a variety of these bacteria, precipitated by crowding and poor water
quality. Therefore, BGD is also called &quot;environmental gill disease&quot;.
Two gliding bacteria, <i>Flavobacterium columnare</i> and <i>F. branchiophilum</i>,
are species specifically incriminated with the disease in freshwater. Other
bacteria may cause or be secondarily involved with the lesions. Key predisposing
factors are high organic loads and possibly high ammonia in the water.
Therefore, the condition is often found in high production trout farms. With
zebrafish, we have seen BGD following shipment in which the fish were in transit
for a long time.</p>
<b>
<p>Clinical Signs and Gross Pathology. </b>Typical of most gill diseases, fish
exhibit labored breathing and may accumulate at the surface with BGD. Fin and
tail infections (known as fin and tail rot), is characterized by erosion of the
fins. Infected skin usually appears white due to loss of the overlying epidermis
and exposure of the dermis.</p>
<b>
<p>Microscopy. </b>Wet mount examinations of infected gills reveal fused
secondary lamellae due to epithelial hyperplasia. Masses of filamentous bacteria
are observed on the surface of the gills. Likewise, masses of bacteria are seen
in wet mount preparations of infected skin or fins. Phase contrast microscopy is
useful for visualization of the bacteria. Histological sections reveal severe
epithelial hyperplasia of the gills and occasionally necrosis. Careful
examination usually reveals mats of bacteria on the gill surface.</p>

<p>Diagnosis</font></b><font FACE="Arial">. Gliding bacteria infections are
usually diagnosed by observing masses of bacteria from the infected tissue. With
BGD, the gill surface is associated with excessive mucus production and
hyperplasia of the gill epithelium. All of these changes can be visualized in
wet mount preparations of the infected tissues. Histology is useful to
demonstrate pathological changes of the gills and the extent of invasion by the
bacteria in the skin.</p>
<b>
<p>Control and Treatment.</b> The best way to avoid BGD and fin and tail rot is
to avoid overcrowding and maintain proper water quality. When shipping, assure
that fish are not feed for a few days before transport, maintain lower densities
in shipping bags, and select the fastest route of travel.</p>
<p>The most common chemical treatment for BGD in salmonids has been chloramine T
at about 6-15 ppm as a 1h bath (<a href="#Bowker">Bowker and Erdahl 1998</a>). Repeated treatments may be
required. <a href="#Lumsden"> Lumsden et al. (1998)</a> compared this drug with hydrogen peroxide for
treating experimental infections in trout, and ultimately recommended 100 mg/L
hydrogen peroxide (1 h baths) as an effective treatment as well. However, we
have not tested hydrogen peroxide on zebrafish.</p>

yellowish, parasitic dinoflagellate in which one stage infects the skin and
gills of fish. The parasite can multiply very rapidly in aquaria and will
rapidly kill fish. This is a common pathogen of ornamental fishes. The dinospore
stage infects fish, and transforms into a trophont stage that attaches to the
surface, especially gills, and apparently feeds on the host’s epithelium.
After several days, this stage leaves the host and forms a tomont. This off-host
stage undergoes several divisions, resulting in 256 infective motile dinospores
which go on to infect other fish. The life cycle is completed in about 2 wk
under optimal conditions (ca 23-26 <sup>o</sup>C).</p>

</b>
<p>Neural microsporidiosis in zebrafish was first reported in 1980 in France (<a href="#Kinkelin">de
Kinkelin 1980</a>). The parasite has now been identified in zebrafish at many
research and commercial facilities, and was recently assigned to a new genus and
species, <i>Pseudoloma neurophilia</i> by <a href="#Matthews"> Matthews et al.
(2001)</a>. The infection
appears to be linked to severe emaciation (often referred to as ‘skinny
disease’), but its precise role (primary cause or secondary opportunist) has
yet to be resolved. The infection is also found routinely in normal, healthy
appearing fish. In a preliminary prevalence study at the University of Oregon Huestis Hall facility, 97% (29/30) of &quot;skinny&quot; fish and 30% (10/30) of
normal, healthy appearing adult fish have microsporidial spores detectable by
wet mounts of dissected spinal cords, and the former had heavier infections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Microsporidia are obligate intracellular parasites with a complicated life
cycle. The life cycle concludes with the production of an infectious and
resistant spore, which is the only stage of the parasite that can live outside
of the host cell. With most microsporidia, transmission occurs via the ingestion
of the infective spore stage, and we have found the infection in exposed fish as
soon as 8 wk after feeding infected tissues. There have also been reports of
vertical transmission in other microsporidia of both vertebrates and
invertebrates (<a href="#Bandi">Bandi et al. 2001</a>; <a href="#Dunn"> Dunn et al.
2001</a>). We detect the spores of <i>Pseudoloma</i>
in the ovaries and within eggs of zebrafish, and the role of vertical
transmission of <i>Pseudoloma</i> in the spread of the infection is currently
under investigation in our laboratory. Enhanced methods for diagnosis and
treatment of the infection, and the link between the microsporidian and skinny
disease are also topics that we are studying.</p>
<b>
<p>Clinical Disease and Gross Pathology. </b>Emaciation and spinal curvature,
such as scoliosis, are common in infected fish.</p>
<b>
<p>Microscopy. </b>The primary site of infection is the central nervous system
(spinal cord and hindbrain). Spores and associated inflammation are also noted
occasionally in the skeletal muscle surrounding vertebrae and ventral nerve

<p>Diagnosis</font></b><font FACE="Arial">. The infection can be detected in wet
mounts of the central nervous system that have been carefully dissected from
infected fish. Because this is tedious and laborious, histology is the routine
method by which the infection is observed. Spores are ovoid to pyriform, with a
prominent posterior vacuole, and average 5.4 x 2.7 </font><font FACE="WP MathA">F</font><font FACE="Arial">m.
The microsporidium produces xenomas within the spinal cord and hindbrain of
fish, and xenomas contain sporophorous vesicles with up to 16 spores.
Sporoblasts and presporoblast stages (probably sporonts) are found rarely in
small aggregates dispersed randomly throughout xenomas. Fungi-Fluor (<a href="http://www.polysciences.com">Polysciences,
Warrington, PA</a> </font><font FACE="Arial">fluorescent stain binds nonspecifically to
beta-linked polysaccharides found in cells containing chitin. As chitin occurs
in spore walls of microsporidia, this stain is excellent for demonstrating
spores in either tissue smears or histological sections. <a href="#Weber"> Weber et al. (1999)</a>
describes a related stain (Calcofluor) and other staining techniques for the
identification of microsporidia.</p>
<b>
<p>Control and Treatment.</b> Fumagillin has been widely used as an oral
treatment for fish microsporidosis, usually with good success (see review by <a href="#Shaw &amp; Kent">
Shaw and Kent 1999</a>). Fumagillin was first developed for treating <i>Nosema apis </i>infections
in honey bees. <a href="#Kano"> Kano et al. (1982)</a> reported that fumagillin was effective against
the microsporidium <i>H. anguillarum</i> in eels (<i>Anguilla japonica</i>).
Since this first report on treating microsporidiosis in fish with fumagillin,
the drug has been used to treat <i>N. salmonis </i>infections in chinook salmon
(<a href="#Hedrick">Hedrick et al. 1991</a>) and <i>Loma salmonae </i>infections in chinook salmon
(<a href="#Kent &amp; Dawe">Kent and Dawe 1994</a>). However, this has not been tested with zebrafish
microsporidiosis. The best method for control as this time is to remove and
euthanize all emaciated and moribund fish as soon as possible to prevent
cannibalism and further transmission.&nbsp;</p>
<p> Microsporidian spores may be resistant to
disinfectants (<a href="#Shaw 1999">Shaw et al. 1999</a>), and at present it is not known if the levels
of chlorine routinely used to surface disinfect eggs (chlorine 25 ppm for 5 min)
will kill the spores. Moreover, we have observed eggs filled spores of <i>Pseudoloma</i>.
The spores within intact eggs could be protected from chlorine, even if this
concentration is effective for killing spores. It is recommended that all
nonviable, unfertilized eggs be removed prior to the bleaching procedure.</p>

Extensive literature is available on control strategies for Ich, and the most
common treatment is an external bath with formalin. Usually fish are treated
with formalin at about 1:4-5,000 formalin for 1 hour. Each fish species responds
differently to formalin, and thus a few fish should be tested before applying
the treatment to large numbers. The treatment must be carried-out diligently as
the stages under the skin are somewhat protected from external baths. In other
words, multiple treatments may be required. Furthermore, the entire system
should be treated to destroy the off-host stages of the parasite, which may be
detrimental to biological filters.</font></p>

</b></font>
<p><font FACE="Arial">Metazoan parasites (helminths and arthropods) are
important causes of disease in captive fishes, including warm water species.
Because zebrafish colonies usually use dechlorinated city water and are
maintained in closed systems, metazoan parasites (particularly those requiring
intermediate hosts) are not numerous in these facilities. Capillarid nematodes
are one of the few metazoans that have been recognized as a problem in zebrafish
facilities (<a href="#Pack">Pack et al. 1995</a>; <a href="#Kent"> Kent et al.
2002</a>).</p>
<p>The species infecting zebrafish was first identified as <i><a name="Pseudocapillaria tomentosa">Pseudocapillaria
tomentosa</a> </i>by Dr. R. Overstreet, University of Southern Mississippi (pers.
comm.), and the specimens that we have evaluated from zebrafish are consistent
with this identification. Capillarids infect all classes of vertebrates, and are
often pathogenic due to their invasive nature (<a href="#Moravec 1987">Moravec
1987</a>; <a href="#Moraveck 1987a"> Moravec et al.
1987a</a> ). Many species have been described from fishes, including aquarium
species (<a href="#Williams &amp; Jones">Williams and Jones 1994</a>).</p>
<p><i>Pseudocapillaria tomentosa</i> (junior synonym <i>P. brevispicula</i>) has
a broad host specificity, infecting some 25 fishes in the family Cyprinidae and
members of other orders such as Aguilliformes (eels), Gadiformes (cod fishes),
Salmoniformes (salmon) and Siluriformes (catfishes) (<a href="#Moravec 1987">Moravec
1987</a>). <i>Pseudocapillaria
tomentosa</i> was associated with mortality in captive tiger barbs (<i>Puntius
tetrazona</i>) (<a href="#Moravec 1984">Moravec et al. 1984</a>) and related parasites cause disease in
other aquarium fishes. <i>Capillaria pterophylii</i> has been recognized for
many years as a common pathogen of captive angelfish and discus fish (<a href="#Richenbach">Richenbach-Klinke
1952</a>) and <i>Capillostrogyloides ancistri</i> is highly pathogenic to the
bushymouth catfish <i>Ancistrus dolichopterus</i> (<a href="#Moravec 1987b">Moravec et al.
1987b</a>). <a href="#Lomankin">
Lomankin and Trofimeko (1982)</a> showed that oligochaetes (e.g., <i>Tubifex tubifex</i>)
can serve as paratenic hosts for <i>P. tomentosa</i> in laboratory transmission
studies. In the same study, they demonstrated that direct transmission in the
absence of worms is also a route of infections. Recently, we confirmed that the
parasite can be transferred from fish to fish in the absence of oligochaete
worms, which demonstrates that the parasite can proliferate in zebrafish
research facilities.</p>
<p><b>Clinical Signs and Gross Pathology</b>. Heavily infected fish are often
dark, emaciated, and lethargic. Necropsy may reveal liver enlargement and
anemia.</p>
<b>
<p>Microscopy.</b> Females of <i>P. tomentosa</i> are long (7-12 mm) and thin,
and gravid worms are replete with the distinctive eggs that are visualized in
wet mount preparations of the gut. Males are smaller, about 4- 7 mm in length.
Histological sections reveal the worms within the gut wall and, at times, are
associated with a severe cellutitis of the infected region The tissue reaction
can be severe, diffuse and may extend through the entire visceral cavity. The
infection also seems to predispose fish to intestinal neoplasms (<a href="#Kent">Kent et al.
2002</a>) – see </font><b><font FACE="Arial" color="#FF00FF"><a href="#NEOPLASTIC DISEASES">Neoplasia</a></font><font FACE="Arial">.</font></p>
</b><font FACE="Arial"><b>
<p>Diagnosis</b>. Identification of capillarid nematodes is most easily
accomplished by the presence of unique eggs, which are oval and contain
distinctive bipolar plugs. Precise identification to the species level requires
careful examination of the male sexual organs, which are rather diminutive in <i>Pseudocapillaria</i>
spp. Females of <i>P. tomentosa</i> are about 7-12 mm, males about 4-7 mm. To
date, the only nematode infection that we have identified in zebrafish from
research facilities is <i>P. tomentosa.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Control and Treatment.</b> Oligochaete worms may be a source of the
infection, and thus should be avoided as food, particularly if their source is
unknown. As direct transmission occurs between fish, the infection can spread
within a population if not controlled. If fish are not highly valuable, the most
appropriate choice would be to eliminate the infected population. At present,
the infection is not wide spread in research facilities, perhaps due to
bleaching of eggs and quarantine procedures.</p>
<p>Ivermectin is a very effective antihelminthic for many nematode and arthropod
infections in terrestrial animals, and has been employed for treating nematode
infections in fishes (<a href="#Heckman">Heckman 1985</a>). Therefore, ivermectin should be considered
as a possible treatment for <i>P. tomentosa</i> in zebrafish. However, this drug
has not been tested with zebrafish, and there appears to be a great variability
is the tolerance of the drug between even closely related fish species – i.e.,
many fish species are highly susceptible to toxic side effects of ivermectin at
doses used in mammals (<a href="#Johnson 1993">Johnson et al. 1993</a>: <a href="#Kilmartin">Kilmartin et al.
1997</a>), presumably
because of a comparatively reduced blood/brain barrier causing neurotoxicity.
This drug has also been associated with respiratory problems in fish (<a href="#Toovey">Toovey et
al. 1999</a>).</p>
<p>Oral or bath treatments with levamisole and fenbendazole have also been
employed to treat nematode infections in fish (<a href="#Noga">Noga 1996</a>), but <a href="#Hoffman"> Hoffman (1982)</a>
found that levamisole was not effective for treating capillarid infections in
golden shiners. Brood stock zebrafish treated with levamisole have become
sterile (D. Weaver, Scientific Hatcheries, Huntington Beach, California, pers.
comm.). <a href="#Pack"> Pack et al. (1995)</a> reported that a mixture of trichlorofon and
mebendazole in the form of Fluke-Tabs (Aquarium Products, Glen Burnie, MD) added
to water eliminated the infection. Treated fish gained weight and when examined
later the infection was not observed. Dr. Weaver has reported success with
treating <i>P. tomentosa</i> infections using pyrantel and garlic powder
incorporated in the feed in a production situation.</p>

<p>This condition occurs in many species of fish held in captivity, and we
occasionally observe it in our diagnostic cases. Nephrocalcinosis is the
accumulation of calcium deposits in kidney tubules and collecting ducts. Causes
of nephrocalcinosis include high CO<sub>2</sub> (e.g., &gt; 12 mg/L) in water or
excessive levels of calcium and magnesium in the diet. The use of calcium
carbonate (rather than sodium bicarbonate) to buffer water in recirculating
systems has been associated with the condition (<a href="#Chen 2001">Chen et al.

lesions are extensive is the condition associated with overt clinical disease.
In other words, we see many fish with the condition (diagnosed by histology) in
which it was probably not a significant cause of the disease.</p>
<p><b>Clinical Signs and Gross Pathology.</b> We have not observed macroscopic
changes due to nephrocalcinosis in zebrafish. However, with larger fish, kidneys

<p>Many research facilities use flow through or partially closed systems in
which dechlorinated city water is used as the water supply. This certainly is an
advantage for avoiding many pathogens. However, failure of the dechlorination
system often results in severe mortality due to either acute or chronic chlorine
toxicity. Fish are very susceptible to chlorine. City water usually contains a
minimum of 0.2mg/L total chlorine but usually ranges between 0.5 –1.0 mg/L (<a href="#Noga">Noga

inadequate rinsing or ventilation is another potential source of chlorine
toxicity.</p>
<b>
<p>Clinical Signs and Gross Pathology.</b> Chlorine causes severe, acute
necrosis of the gills, and thus fish suffer rapid respiratory distress and
asphyxiation. Fish may exhibit laboured breathing, and petechial hemorrhages
around the head. Cherry-red, swollen gills are characteristics of chlorine
toxicity</p>
<b>
<p>Microscopy</b>. Microscopic examination shows severe necrosis of the gills.</p>

<b>
<p>Control and Treatment</b>. Chlorine is avoided by removal with charcoal
filters (for running water). For static systems, chlorine can be removed by
adding sodium thiosulfate at 7.4 ppm/chlorine ppm). Mortalities in exposed fish
can be reduced by adding salt to the water and by assuring that the water is
adequately aerated. In addition, fish should be immediately transferred to
chlorine-free, aerated water.</p>

is particularly problematic in newly established recirculating systems, in

<b>
<p>Microscopic Changes</b>. Chronic ammonia toxicity is often associated with
hyperplasia of the gill epithelium. However, some researchers report that this
histopathological change is caused by other agents (either abiotic or
biological) that are often associated with husbandry conditions (e.g., excessive
crowding, inappropriate water exchange) that lead to elevated ammonia levels (<a href="#Lang">Lang et al.

densities are the immediate solutions to NH<sub>3 </sub>toxicity<sub>. </sub>Changing
water or increasing water flow usually increases pH, and ammonia is more toxic
at higher pH. Ammonia toxicity often occurs in new recirculation systems with
biological filters as it may take several weeks to establish adequate

<p>Gas bubble disease (GBD) occurs when fish are exposed to local dissolved gas
concentrations exceeding the stable maximum dissolved gas levels for the local
temperature, salinity, and pressure conditions (supersaturated conditions). If
this condition is not corrected fast enough or if it is too far out of
equilibrium, the gas dissolved in the water in excess of equilibrium will be
released from solution. After exposure to these conditions, the fish’s
internal body fluids can also become unstably supersaturated with gases. These
excess gases can then be released from solution as bubbles, resulting in tissue
damage. Gas bubble disease afflicts both wild and cultured fish in variety of
conditions. See reviews by <a href="#Weitkamp"> Weitkamp and Katz (1980)</a> and
<a href="#Speare 1998"> Speare (1998)</a>.</font><b><font FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800080">
</font></b><font FACE="Arial">A variety of scenarios can cause supersaturation,
including air injection into water in pressurized pipes (Venturi effect), and
pumping water from deep wells and exposing fish to such water without prior gas
&quot;stripping&quot;. Supersaturation by nitrogen is generally the culprit, but
oxygen alone (i.e., in systems using oxygen injection) may cause GBD. With
zebrafish research systems, the cause is often a leaky pipe on the suction side
of the pump, which causes air injection.</p>
<b>
<p>Clinical Signs and Macroscopic Changes.</b> Severe, acute GBD may cause
macroscopically visible bubbles in the skin, fins or gills. The eyes are also a
target organ, in which visible bubbles form in the retrobulbar tissues. Fish may
exhibit exophthalmia. Unfortunately, many cases of GDB do not present with
specific clinical or pathological changes – i.e., fish die without visible
bubbles in the tissues. Fish may exhibit exophthalmia. Fish that recover
sublethal GDB may be susceptible to infectious diseases.</p>
<b>
<p>Microscopy.</b> When present, histological sections may reveal bubbles,
particularly in the retrobulbar tissues. Bubbles occur within blood vessels and
cause vascular occlusions, leading to formation of thrombi and possibly
hemorrhage. Gas bubbles may be visible in gill blood vessels in wet mounts.</p>

use as an alarm system. There are possible alternatives that could provide an
indirect indication of this problem with process instruments (instruments for
continuous monitoring of the water conditions). Less direct monitoring can be
provided by a DO (dissolved oxygen) or ORP (oxidation-reduction potential; as a
general indicator of a water change) meters either downstream of the last pump
before the water goes to the fish in a recirculating water system or in a flow
through system in the plumbing leading directly to the tanks. Change detected by
these instruments could be due to supersaturation, or other causes. It could
provide a preliminary indication of a problem, but further investigations are
required to verify the cause and they may not be sensitive enough to identify

<p>Pioneering work by Dr. Mearle Stanton of the National Cancer Institute in the
1960s was the first research demonstrating experimental carcinogenesis in fish.
This work showed that the zebrafish developed liver neoplasia after exposure to
diethylnitrosamine or methylazoxymethanol acetate (<a href="#Stanton 1965">Stanton
1965</a>; <a href="#Stanton 1966"> Stanton 1966</a>).
In a 5-year U.S. Army-funded study of neoplasia induced by a panel of
structurally diverse carcinogens, Drs. Jan Spitsbergen and Jerry Hendricks of
Oregon State University showed that zebrafish of a Florida wild-type line (from
a commercial wholesaler) are quite responsive to most carcinogens if exposed
early in life. Liver was the most commonly targeted organ in these carcinogen
studies with zebrafish, but as with other carcinogenesis studies in small
aquarium fish (<a href="#Bunton">Bunton 1996</a>), a wide variety of epithelial, mesenchymal, neural,
and neural crest neoplasia occurred in fish exposed to many of the carcinogens (<a href="#Hendricks">Hendricks

immersion exposures at the adult stage to 2.5-3 mM ethylnitrosourea. The strain
of zebrafish used in this papilloma study was not specified, but was presumably
Florida wild-type as they were obtained from North American wholesaler.</p>
<p>At Oregon State University, the spontaneous rate of neoplasia in the Florida
wild-type line fed a semi-purified diet and held in a flow-through system was
approximately 1% at 6-14 months of age based on 3,000 untreated control fish.
The most common spontaneous neoplasms at 6-14 months of age were seminoma,
hepatocellular adenoma, and adenoma of exocrine pancreas, with intestinal
adenocarcinoma being less common. A study of 21 Florida wild-type zebrafish over
18 months of age by Dr. Gary Marty indicated that 44% of males had marked
hyperplasia or neoplasia of seminiferous epithelium of testis (Dr. Gary Marty,
School Vet. Med. U.C. Calif., Davis, pers. comm.).</p>

<p>Beginning in 2001, a collaborative study of causes of spontaneous neoplasia
in zebrafish is being conducted by Drs. Jan Spitsbergen and Michael Kent of
Oregon State University and Dr. Monte Westerfield of the University of Oregon.
Their goals are to establish baseline information on the incidences and
histological types of spontaneous neoplasia occurring in various wild-type and
mutant lines of zebrafish, and to determine the relative roles of genetic
factors, infectious diseases, dietary factors and other environmental and
husbandry factors in contributing to neoplasia in zebrafish. We are conducting
histological examination of retired broodstock to determine incidences and
histological types of neoplasia in various lines of zebrafish. We are comparing
spontaneous incidences of neoplasia at 2 years of age in groups of wild type (AB
line) fed different diets. We are also investigating evidence of viral agents in
zebrafish neoplasms by a variety of methods including virus isolation attempts
in cell culture, tumor transmission trials and ultrastructural studies of tumor
tissue and tumor cell lines.</p>

</b>
<p>Until 2001, retired broodstock from the Eugene zebrafish colony have not been
routinely examined by histology. However, moribund fish and fish exhibiting
grossly visible masses or other pathologic lesions have been studied by Dr. Kent
since 1994. Also since 1999, the Zebrafish International Resource Center has
coordinated a diagnostic service to evaluate zebrafish health problems. Several
neoplasms have been diagnosed in cases submitted through this service. Including
diagnostic cases from the University of Oregon and submissions from other
research centers, the most common target tissues for spontaneous neoplasia are
testis, gut, thyroid, liver, peripheral nerve, connective tissue, and the
ultimobranchial gland. Less common target tissues include, blood vessels, brain,
gill, nasal epithelium and the lymphomyeloid system.</p>
<p>Although we are just beginning to accumulate data regarding age-specific
incidences of neoplasia in various lines of zebrafish, it is clear that the
incidence of neoplasia increases strongly with age over one year in the lines
examined. For example, the incidence of seminomas (neoplasms of the seminiferous
epithelium of testis) is typically less than 1% in fish of all lines examined so
far at less than 1 year of age. But the incidence of seminomas increases to
approximately 40% by two years of age or more.</p>
<p>The following are descriptions of the common neoplasms that we have observed
at our facilities in Oregon and from diagnostic cases from other research
facilities.</p>

causing marked abdominal distention, and constituting about half of the body
mass. These neoplasms are typically soft, white, multilobulated masses and, in
our experience, have always been confined to the testis.</p>

<p>Unlike most seminomas of mammals which are comprised principally of a
monotonous sheet of germ cells, most seminomas of fish are spermatocytic
seminomas with extensive differentiation of germ cells into various
developmental stages up to sperm (<a href="#Hawkins 1996">Hawkins et al. 1996</a>). Small seminomas may be
comprised of a single lobule of proliferative seminiferous epithelium
compressing the surrounding normal testicular tissue. Large seminomas may be
multilobular. Various ratios of primordial germ cells to differentiating
spermatocytes and spermatids may occur in different seminomas. Most of the
seminomas that we have seen are well differentiated, with histological
structures evident that are typically found in normal testes.</p>

<p>The ultimobranchial gland is an endocrine structure that occurs transiently
during the development of mammals, but remains a distinct organ in adult fish
and birds. This gland of fish is the counterpart to the thyroid C cells (medullary
thyroid tissue) in mammals. Like C cells, the ultimobranchial gland secretes
calcitonin to regulate blood calcium levels. Studies of both diagnostic cases
from moribund fish and retired broodstock indicate that the incidence of
ultimobrachial neoplasia increases substantially in fish over 1.5 year of age.
In most lines of zebrafish, we typically do not see a mass grossly in fish
affected by ultimobranchial tumors, but usually detect this tumor during
histologic studies. Because both seminomas and ultimobranchial tumors are common
in male fish over 1.5 year of age, we often see these tumors together in older
males. We have seen several cases in the Tübingen <i>long fin</i> line [also
called TUP longfin, TL, <i>leopard</i> (<i>leo</i>) <i>long fin</i> (<i>lof</i>)]
in which the abdomen was grossly distended due to marked enlargement of the
spleen in fish with ultimobranchial neoplasia. In these cases the spleen was up
to 30X normal size, with cystic degeneration, perhaps due to passive congestion.
Ascites also occurred in some cases. The TL line raised in standard husbandry
systems on commercial diets seems prone to develop ultimobranchial tumors at a
relatively young age, with some neoplasms seen by 6 months of age.</p>

<p>The normal ultimobranchial gland of the zebrafish is a small ovoid organ
located between the heart and the esophagus. Because of the small size of the
normal organ, we must typically cut many step sections through the midline
region of a fish to obtain reliable sections of the ultimobranchial gland. The
normal gland consists of a cluster of acini lined by tall columnar cells, with
basally located nuclei. Neoplastic ultimobranchial glands may be enlarged up to
50X normal size. It is remarkable that fish can tolerate such large masses
compressing or invading the heart. Neoplastic ultimobranchial cells lose their
tall columnar structure and acinar arrangement, forming packets or monotonous
sheets of ovoid to polygonal neuroendocrine cells. Malignant neoplasms are
composed of less differentiated epithelial cells which invade through the fine
fibrous capsule which surrounds the normal gland. We have observed several cases
in which large ultimobranchial carcinomas have invaded into the sinus venosus of
the heart.</p>

neoplasia in fish has been controversial because, unlike the thyroid in mammals
which is encapsulated, in fish, most thyroid follicles occur diffusely in
connective tissue surrounding the ventral aorta in the lower jaw. In certain
fish species, normal thyroid tissue can occur in a variety of locations
including spleen and anterior kidney (<a href="#Hoover">Hoover, 1984</a>). In our experience, normal
thyroid tissue of the zebrafish is confined to the vicinity of the ventral aorta
of the lower jaw. Several diagnostic cases of thyroid neoplasia that we have
described have included foci of highly anaplastic epithelial cells which are
clearly malignant histologically, and in certain cases have invaded many tissues
throughout the body. These cases have been confirmed as malignant thyroid
adenocarcinomas by Dr. John Harshbarger of the Registry of Tumors in Lower

hepatocytes, which have typically lost their normal organization into hepatic
plates and often extensively invade into surrounding normal hepatic tissue.</font></p>
<p>These neoplasms are often associated with foci of hepatocellular alteration.
These are clusters of hepatocytes that stain differently from normal hepatocytes,
such as a cytoplasm that is more eosinophilic, more basophilic or more
vacuolated due to glycogen accumulation. However, they maintain their normal
orientation into hepatic plates and do not compress the surrounding parenchyma.
Carcinogenesis studies in mammals and fish indicate that these foci of
hepatocellular alteration are often precursors to hepatic neoplasms. Another
liver tumor that is not uncommon in fish are those with a biliary origin –
e.g., choangiocelluar carcinomas, biliary carcinomas.</p>

yet to identify such agents in zebrafish. Our observations from diagnostic cases
indicate that older fish are predisposed to higher incidences of most neoplasms.
Therefore, removing older fish from colonies should reduce the prevalence of
these tumors. Chronic inflammation associated with parasitism is a well
recognized as a promoter of neoplasia in mammals and appears to be link to
intestinal neoplasia in the zebrafish. In colonies of zebrafish infested with
nematodes, intestinal tumors appear to be linked to infections by <i>Pseudocapillaria</i>

<h3>Processing for Histology</h3>
</b>
<p>Adult zebrafish are often difficult to section without first softening their
skin and scales. The day before processing, transfer the fixed fish to 5%
trichloroacetic acid (TCA) in Dietrich’s fixative, and place on rotor
overnight. TCA will soften the scales and skin, presumably by cleaving the
keratin proteins. In addition, TCA will decalcify, softening the bones.
Unfortunately, TCA is a fairly strong acid and will corrode the tissue
processor. The fish must be thoroughly rinsed to remove any TCA before the fish
can be processed.</p>
<p><b>PROTOCOL:<br>
</b>Transfer fish to 5% TCA in Dietrich’s fixative. Place on rotor overnight.
The next day, replace TCA-containing Dietrich’s with 70% ethanol and place on
rotor for 10 minutes. Repeat 2xs for a total rinse time of 30 minutes. Replace
last rinse with fresh 70% ethanol. The fish are then bisected along their length
before they are processed. Using a fresh razor blade, make the cut parallel to
and on the left side of the spinal cord. The bisected fish are now ready to load
into cassettes for processing.</p>

<h3><b><a name="Sectioning the Fish"><font face="Arial">Sectioning Fish</font></a></b></h3>
<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">
<p>Cut 7 ìm sections with a high-profile disposable blade (AccuEdge blades --
made by Sakura-Finetek, sold through VWR -- are reportedly the best) . If the
large fish are difficult to cut, soak the block face in ice-cold Mollifex.
Usually one to two hours is sufficient but an overnight soak is fine for
stubborn samples.</p>
<p>Sections of gills, spinal cord and internal organs will be needed for proper
pathological evaluation. Because the fish has been cut to one side of the spinal
cord, you will be cutting toward the midline on one half of the fish, and away
from the midline on the other. With any luck, you will need to collect only one
ribbon containing gills (one bisected half) and spinal cord (the other bisected
half), along with a nice sampling of internal organs. Samples of the skin or
fins may also be requested, depending on the reported symptoms.</p>

<h3>Harris' Hematoxylin (Theory &amp; Practice of Histological Techniques,
Bancroft &amp; Stevens, 4th edition, 1996, pp 101-102)</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Hematoxylin 2.5 g</li>
   <li>Absolute alcohol 25 ml</li>
   <li>Potassium alum 50 g</li>
   <li>Distilled Water 500 mL</li>
   <li>Sodium iodate 0.5 g</li>
   <li>glacial acetic acid 20.0 mL</li>
</ul>
<p>The hematoxylin is dissolved in the absolute alcohol, and then added to the
alum, which has previously been dissolved in the warm distilled water in a
2-liter flask. The mixture is rapidly brought to a boil and sodium iodate is
then slowly and carefully added. The stain is rapidly cooled by plunging the
flask into cold water or into a sink containing chipped ice. When the solution
is cold, the acetic acid is added, and the stain is ready for immediate use.</p>
