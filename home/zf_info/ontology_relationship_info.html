<h1>Explanation of relationship types</h1>

<p/>
Three relationships and their reciprocal types are shown between anatomical structures.

<table width="600">
    <tr>
        <td width="150" valign="top" style="font-size:12"><b>Is part of and has part</b></td>
        <td style="font-size:12"> Structure B is a part of structure A during the time at which they both exist.
            Structure A may have a part B during the time at which they both exist.
            <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leaf <b>is part of</b>: tree
            <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tree <b>has part</b>: leaf, trunk, root
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td width="150" valign="top" style="font-size:12"><b>Has type and is a type of</b></td>
        <td style="font-size:12"> Structure B is a type of structure A. Structure A has subtypes B and C.
            <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parrot <b>is a type of</b>: bird
            <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bird <b>has type</b>: parrot, eagle, pigeon
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td width="150" valign="top" style="font-size:12"><b>Develops from and develops into</b></td>
        <td style="font-size:12"> Structure A develops from structure B. Structure B develops into structure A. There
            can be a one to one, one to many, or many to one correspondence. For example, Structure A develops from
            structure B and C, or structure A develops into structure B and C.
            <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cheese <b>develops from</b>: milk, bacteria
            <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;milk <b>develops</b> into: cheese, yogurt, ice cream
        </td>
    </tr>

These relationships are representations of formal types described by the OBO-REL ontology:
