<p><font size="+2"><b>Zebrafish deficiency strains</b></font></p>
<p>Deficiencies are currently being generated and catalogued as part of the Zebrafish 
  Genome Iniative. The funded project (<a href="/ZDB-PERS-960805-225">Marnie
  Halpern</a> and <a href="/ZDB-PERS-960805-645">Andreas
  Fritz</a>, co-PIs) has 4 specific aims:</p>
<p>1. To collect, preserve and catalogue existing deficiency and translocation 
  strains.<br>
  2. To recover and characterize new gamma-ray induced deficiencies. <br>
  3. To localize and determine the extent of deficiencies and assemble a genomic 
  DNA deletion panel uncovering the zebrafish genome. <br>
  4. To document haploid and diploid deficiency phenotypes for the eventual correlation 
  of expressed sequences with mutant phenotypes.</p>
<p>Complete information about these lines is currently available on a <a href="http://www.ciwemb.edu/labs/halpern/zdp.html">webserver</a> 
  at the Carnegie Institution of Washington: Data are also available in a searchable 
  form with links to information about missing genes, markers, map locations, 
  etc. on <a href="/ZFIN">ZFIN</a>. Click on &quot;Search Mutants&quot; 
  and search for &quot;deficiencies, translocations, etc.&quot; under &quot;Mutation 
  Type:&quot;</p>
