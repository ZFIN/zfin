<h3><b><font face="Arial">ACCESS TO FACILITIES</font></b></h3>

<p><font face="Arial">The National Institutes of Health has expanded the list of
organisms eligible for sequencing under the current NIH Mouse BAG Sequencing
Program to include all animals, fungi, and eukaryotic protists (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT
-HG-O1-002.html). This program change is intended to address the interest of the
larger biomedical research community in obtaining sequence information about
specific regions of genomic DNA of biomedical or biological significance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Several of the sequencing centers in the National Human
Genome Research Institute's Genome</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Sequencing Network will dedicate a fraction of their
sequencing capacity to this initiative. Investigators may submit requests to
have one or more BAG clones sequenced from one or more eligible organisms
(plants and prokaryotes are excluded). Requests may be for 4-fold coverage,
6-10-fold coverage, or finished sequence. Any BAG sequenced from the mouse
RPGI-23 library or the rat BAG library designated for genomic sequencing will be
finished so that the sequence will be maximally useful to the centers generating
the sequence of the entire genome. Requestors whose projects have been approved
must also provide the BAG clone(s) to the participating sequencing centers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">An Investigator interested in obtaining the sequence of a
specific region of genomic DNA that has been cloned in a BAG may submit a short,
Web-based request describing the region, its importance, and its readiness to be
sequenced. A panel of peer reviewers will consider the requests and advise the
NHGRI on the priority of the regions requested. Those judged to be sufficiently
important to warrant priority sequencing will be listed for the centers engaged
in mouse genomic sequencing to choose and sequence, up to the maximum capacity
available for this activity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">There will be no cost to investigators seeking this
sequencing service; the sequencing will be done by centers that have already
been funded through the Network. However, as with all sequence data generated by
the Human Genome Project, unfinished data will be submitted to GenBank within 24
hours of generation of 2kb assemblies, and finished data as soon as completed.
No sequence data will be made available to the requestor prior to public
release. All publications using this data must acknowledge the publicly funded
sequencing effort. If BAG clones that are approved for sequencing are not
available commercially, the requestor must agree to make the clone(s) available
for distribution in an expeditious manner upon publication using any or all of
the data generated by the public effort.</font></p>
