<H3>ELECTRONIC ZEBRAFISH</H3></b>
<p>
By M. Westerfield, Institute of Neuroscience, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403-1254 USA.
<p>
In response to discussions at the Cold Spring Harbor meeting about putting various zebrafish databases onto the Internet (see article by J. Eisen, this issue), two servers have been established.   Both are available on the World Wide Web and accessible with programs like <i>Mosaic</i>.
<p>
One server is accessible at: '/'.  It contains information about:<i><p>
The Zebrafish Book</i> - a guide for the laboratory use of zebrafish.<p>
The Zebrafish Genetic Map - information on the map and on mapping genes and mutations.<p>
Zebrafish Genetic Strains -  a listing of zebrafish wild-type and mutant strains.<p>
Zebrafish Molecular Probes - information on DNA libraries, cloned genes, and antibodies.<i><p>
The Zebrafish Science Monitor</i> - back issues and the upcoming issue.<p>
Zebrafish References -  a listing of zebrafish research publications.<p>
Zebrafish Research Community - an address book of zebrafish researchers.<p>
<p>
The other server can be accessed at: 'http://zebra.scarolina.edu/'.  It provides Zebrafish news, updates and postings  and pointers to a wide range of other information databases about fish care, etc.
<p>
If you don't know how to access a database, don't worry.  You can either ask a local internet guru or wait for a detailed description of 'how to', which will be forthcoming by email distribution and in the next <i>Monitor</i> issue.
