<p>
By J.S. Eisen<I>1</I> and S. Fraser<I>2</I><BR>
<I>1</I>Institute of Neuroscience, 1254 University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403-1254 and <I>2</I>Division of Biology 139-74, CalTech, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.<p>
	<p>
The first open invitation meeting on <i>Zebrafish Development and Genetics</i> was held April 27-May 1 at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.  The attendance of the meeting was phenomenal (337 registrants) and there were 186 poster and slide presentations covering topics including cell fate, genetics, methodology, gastrulation, patterning, morphogenesis, growth control, nervous system development and function, and organogenesis.  	<p>
One session of the meeting was devoted to <i>Community Organization</i>. At this session, we discussed a number of issues of importance to the zebrafish research community.  The main goal of the session was to establish working groups to propose solutions to these issues.	<p>
A brief synopsis of each discussion is reported below, along with the names of the members of the working group.  If you have specific concerns about a particular area, you should contact a member of that working group directly.  Addresses and phone numbers can be obtained from Pat Edwards: FAX (503) 346-4548; e-mail edwards@uoneuro.uoregon.edu.  The working groups will report their progress in upcoming issues of the <i>Monitor</i>.<p>
<p>
1.	Information Transfer:<p>
	<p>
<DIR>
<LI>A.	<i>Zebrafish Science Monitor</i>:			<p>
<LI><DIR>
<LI><LI>1. <b>Monte Westerfield</b>, the editor, reported that the cost per issue is about $600 for postage and printing.			<p>
<LI><LI>2. Meeting attendees felt that the <i>Monitor</i> is doing an excellent job of communicating information within the community, although <b>Monte</b> would like to see more unpublished communications; everyone is reminded that the <i>Monitor</i> cannot be cited, except as personal communication with the permission of the author.			<p>
<LI><LI>3. Once an electronic network is established, the <i>Monitor</i> will be available electronically even before publication.			<p>
<LI><LI>4. A question arose as to the appropriateness of researchers using other organisms (eg <i>Xenopus, medaka, pufferfish</i>) contributing to the <i>Monitor</i>; <b>Igor Dawid</b> was designated as the contact person.			<p>
<LI><li>5. Further information on the <i>Monitor</i> can be obtained from <b>Pat Edwards</b> at: edwards@uoneuro.uoregon.edu.
<LI></DIR>
<LI>	<p>
<LI>B.	Interactive electronic network:		<b>	<p>
<LI>Perry Hackett</b>, <b>Paul Myers</b>, <b>Dick Vogt</b>, and <b>Monte Westerfield</b> will work together to establish an interactive electronic network, probably modeled on the one used by <i>C. elegans</i> researchers.  <p>
<LI>	<p>
<LI>C.	Access to the mailing list:			<p>
<LI>Once the network is up and running, the mailing list will be available to anyone who can access the network.<p>
</DIR><p>
2.	Stock center:<p>
		<p>
<DIR>
<LI>A.	The need for a centralized stock center was unresolved.  However, if we want to have one in place within 2-3 years, now is the time to start planning, decide what a stock center would carry and how to maintain quality control, identify funding sources, write proposals, etc.		<p>
<LI>B.	<b>Janni N&uuml;sslein-Volhard</b> stressed the importance of having the stock centers associated with labs.  If the decision is to establish stock centers, she would probably be willing to have a stock center associated with her facility.		<p>
<LI>C.	It may be necessary to have multiple centers to carry various types of stocks.  In addition, it is difficult to get fish into the UK from the US, thus, it may be necessary to have duplicate stock centers in the US and Europe.  		<p>
<LI>D.	A committee composed of <b>A. Chandrasekhar, Wolfgang Driever, Marnie Halpern, Linda Ross, Charlene Walker, Jim Weston</b> and<b> Steve Wilson</b> will look into the possibilities for initiating and funding stock centers.		<p>
<li>E.	<b>Bob Karp</b> from the <i>National Institute of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse</i> volunteered to provide the names of contacts for federal funding sources.<p>
</DIR>
<p>
3.	Wild-type and lethal-free lines:	<p>
<DIR>
<LI>A.	Several wild-type and lethal-free lines currently exist; more information and fish can be obtained by contacting the indicated persons:			<p>
<LI><DIR>
<LI><LI>1. Oregon AB and AB* (<b>Charline Walker</b>, University of Oregon)		<p>
<LI><LI>2. AB subline (MGH)		<p>
<LI><LI>3. T&uuml;bingen (<b>Mary Mullins</b>, Max-Planck-Institut)			<p>
<LI><LI>4. Darjeeling (<b>Steve Johnson</b>, University of Oregon; still not entirely lethal-free)		<p>
<LI><LI>5. Longfin (<b>Mary Mullins and Steve Johnson</b>)	<p>
<li></DIR>B.	AB x T&uuml;bingen is a very vigorous stock<p>
</DIR>
<p>
4.	Central Reagent Facility:		<p>
<DIR>
<LI>A. Antibodies should be made available through the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank.		<p>
<LI>B. Information about reagents should be part of the database that is being established.		<p>
<LI>C. <b>David Grunwald</b> (email grunwald@gene1.med.utah.edu) is collecting information on reagents, including genomic libraries, cDNA libraries, etc.<p>
<li><
</DIR></dir><p>
5.	Nomenclature:	<p>
<DIR>
<LI>A. The name of the species appears to be <i>Danio rerio</i>.		<p>
<LI>B. Naming of genes and mutations was previously discussed and the decisions published in the <i>Monitor</i> <b>2</b>(3):4-5.  This article will be reprinted on a regular basis. 		<p>
<li>C. A committee composed of <b>Chuck Kimmel, Mary Mullins, Jose Campos-Ortega, John Postlethwait</b> and<b> Nigel Holder</b>
 will continue to consider issues involving nomenclature.</DIR><p>
6.	Embryological Atlases:		<p>
Several groups are considering or in the process of putting together anatomical or staging atlases.  Each group should email information about their atlas to the <i>Monitor</i> (edwards@uoneuro.uoregon.edu).  At least some of the atlases will be made available on the electronic network.<p>
<p>
7.	Genomics:		<p>
<DIR>
<LI>A. Over the summer, <b>John Postlethwait</b> and <b>Howard Jacob</b> will get together and decide how to put the RAPD and SSR maps together.		<p>
<LI>B. RAPD primers for mapping are available from:<BR>
<LI>Operon (1 800-688-2248)					<br>
<LI>1000 Atlantic Ave					<br>
<LI>Alameda, CA  94501					<p>
<LI>For advice contact <b>John Postlethwait</b>:					<br>
<LI>jpostle@oregon.uoregon.edu		<p>
<li>C. A committee composed of <b>Mark Ekker, Denice Smith, Trevor Jowett</b> and<b> Keith Cheng</b> will deal with mapping issues.
</DIR><p>
<p>
8.	Tanks:		<p>
<DIR>
<LI>A. The <i>Monitor</i> will devote an issue to tank design, under the direction of a committee composed of <b>Janni N&uuml;sslein-Volhard, Stephan Schulte-Merker, Bill Trevarrow</b> and<b> Robert Riggleman</b>.		<p>
<li>B. <b>Paul Linser</b> will find out about raising rotifers from his colleague at Whitney Marine Lab<p>
</DIR>
9.	Next meeting:	<p>
<DIR>
<LI>A. We decided to meet every 2 years		<p>
<li>B. The next meeting will be at Cold Spring Harbor and will be organized by: <b>Janni N&uuml;sslein-Volhard, Monte Westerfield, Phil Ingham</b> and <b>Nigel Holder</b>.
