The zebrafish has recently emerged as a useful system for understanding vertebrate developmental genetics, despite the lack of a linkage map.  To identify DNA-based genetic polymorphisms for constructing a genetic map, we have screened a collection of RAPD primers for their utility in identifying genetic polymorphisms between two laboratory strains of zebrafish. Here, we report 116 primers that identify 721 strain-specific genetic markers and show how they can be use din haploid genetics of zebrafish.
