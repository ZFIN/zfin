<b>PRODUCTION OF ANDROGENETIC HAPLOIDS AND DIPLOIDS</b>
<p>

<p>
	We have visual and molecular marker evidence that we have produced haploid and diploid androgenetic zebrafish. Androgenotes inherit all of their chromosomes from their father and none from their mother.
<p> 
	Androgenesis is a technique that can be useful in considering a variety of
genetic phenomena, including: rates of meiotic recombination in
spermatogenesis, detection and mapping of male specific DNA markers or linkage
groups (if any exist), basis of sex determination in zebrafish, and the role of
imprinting of essential paternal genes, if any.
<p>
	Androgenetic haploids are produced by irradiating eggs to destroy the maternal genome, followed by fertilization. By inhibition of either karyokinesis or cytokinesis of the first mitotic division, diploid androgenotes can be produced. For irradiation of eggs we use a cabinet x-ray source that is commercially manufactured for detection of fractures in airplane and other critical parts, the Torrex 150D x-ray inspection system (Faxitron X-Ray Corp., Buffalo Grove, IL, USA; phone (708) 465-9729). The initial cost is approximately $17,000 US. When switched off, the source is extremely safe. Radioisotope sources are also useful for irradiating eggs. Disadvantages of using a radioisotope source for irradiation include: set up expenses, regulations and precautions necessary for isotope use, and the requirement of a room dedicated for irradiation purposes. X-ray dosimetry was performed with a MDH1515 dosimeter using a MDH model 10X5-180 ion chamber (paddle chamber). This was calibrated with a known <sup>137</sup>Cs source (NBS <sup>137</sup>Cs source #47455).
<p> 
	We heat shock zygotes to inhibit the first mitotic division. After
fertilization, eggs are held at 28.5+/-0.5C. Eggs are heat shocked
13 minutes after fertilization for 2 minutes at 41.4+/-0.05C.
Temperatures were measured with a calibrated thermometer (Fisher Scientific,
Cat. No. 15041A) with an uncertainty in temperature certified not to exceed
0.03C.
<p>
	In a recent experiment, we collected eggs from one female (from a line which
originated from zebrafish bought from pet stores in Vancouver Island, B.C. and
assumed not to be closely related to Eugene's AB line) and the milt from one
male (*AB line from Charline Walker, which has been screened to reduce
recessive lethals). The eggs were held in ovarian fluid at room temperature for
50 minutes, the time required for irradiation of eggs. The milt was collected
just prior to being used for fertilization and was held in sperm extender. 204
eggs were irradiated with 10,000 R of x-rays. These eggs and 76 eggs which were
not irradiated (control group) were then fertilized. 72% of the control group
were observed developing normally at 24 hr.  All of these subsequently hatched
and appeared to be diploids. Of the 204 eggs that were irradiated and
subsequently fertilized, 49 were not heat shocked (treatment to produce haploid
androgenotes) and 155 were heat shocked to produce diploid androgenotes.
<p>
	In the group whose eggs were irradiated (to destroy the maternal genome) but not heat shocked, 5 embryos developed, all of which exhibited the haploid syndrome (shortened body, small melanocytes). These are putative androgenetic haploids. In the group whose eggs were irradiated and then heat shocked to inhibit the first mitotic division, 2 normal looking diploids developed (putative diploid androgenotes).
<p> 
	The haploid syndrome can be seen at 24 hours as a shortened body phenotype (Figure 1). At 48 hours, the shortened body is easily noticeable and the difference in size of melanocyte starts to become noticeable (Figure 1) and is pronounced by 96 hours (not shown). The development of putative androgenetic diploid embryos was initially slightly retarded (Figure 1). However, by the end of the first month, these fish achieve approximately the same size as the diploid control fish.

	The lack of any embryos that appeared to be diploid in our irradiated and
non-heat shocked group suggests that the irradiation dosage was sufficient to
destroy the maternal genome, or somehow impeded its transfer to the offspring.
Thus, we believe the surviving diploid embryos in the irradiated and heat
shocked group, are indeed androgenetic rather than resulting from a failure to
eliminate the maternal genome.  Putative haploid androgenotes often hatch, but
seldom feed. They usually die during the first few weeks of life. We have
apparently healthy, active putative diploid androgenotes which are over a month
old.
<p>
	The percentage of haploid and diploid androgenotes produced relative to our
control group was 14% and 2%, respectively. We believe we can increase these
production rates with further refinement of the technique. 

<p>
	Genetic analysis was performed using polymorphic DNA markers that were
fluorescently labeled during PCR and detected on an ABI 373 Automated
Sequencer, thus enabling precise sizing and clear identification of markers.
None of the maternal specific markers we have identified to date, some of which
are homozygous, are inherited by either the haploid or diploid putative
androgenotes we have produced. This does not preclude the possibility of some
leakage of maternal DNA to the putative androgenotes, but it is compelling
evidence that we have produced zebrafish which are lacking a substantial
proportion of the maternal genome. We have confidence in our makers as all DNA
markers identified in the parents, many of which are not polymorphic, were
observed in at least some of the normal diploid progeny. Markers were
considered homozygous if they were observed in all 12 normal diploid progeny
analyzed.<p>

	The sex ratios we will observe in the progeny of our androgenetic zebrafish,
may be informative about the mode of sex determination in zebrafish, which is
presently not understood. The survival of diploid zebrafish androgenotes
suggests a lack of male specific imprinting of essential genes as has been
observed in mammalian species.
