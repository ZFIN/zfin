	A large family of genes encodes proteins with RNA recognition motifs that are presumed to bind RNA and to function in posttranscriptional regulation.  Neural- specific members of this family include <i>elav</i>, a gene required for correct differentiation and maintenance of neurons in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and a related gene, <i>HuD</i>, which is expressed in human neuronal cells.  I have identified genes related to <i>elav</i> and HuD in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>, zebrafish and mouse that define a family of four highly related vertebrate <i>elav</i>- like genes (<i>elrA</i>, <i>elrB</i>, <i>elrC</i> and <i>elrD</i>) in fish, frogs, and mammals.  In addition to protein sequence conservation, a segment of the 3' untranslated sequence of <i>elrD</i> also is conserved, implying a functional role in <i>elrD</i> expression. In adult frogs, <i>elrC</i> and <i>elrD</i> are exclusively expressed in the brain, while <i>elrB</i> is expressed in brain, testis and ovary.  During <i>Xenopus</i> development, <i>elrC</i> and <i>elrD</i> RNAs are detected by late gastrula and late neurula stages, respectively, while a nervous system- specific <i>elrB</i> RNA species is expressed by early tadpole stage.  Additional <i>elrB</i> transcripts are detected in the ovary and early embryo, demonstrating a maternal supply of mRNA and possibly of protein. These expression patterns suggest a role for different <i>elav</i>- like genes in early development and neuronal differentiation. Surprisingly, <i>elrA</i> is expressed in all adult tissues tested and at all times during development. Thus, the widely- expressed <i>elrA</i> is expected to have a related function in all cells.
