At the zebrafish Cold Spring Harbor meeting last year, a committee was
selected to investigate establishment of an on-line database for zebrafish
information. In November, the NSF announced a special program for biological
databases and we applied.
<p>
The application was funded and design and implementation of the database system will begin in September. The prototype server will be set up in Eugene within a year and a second mirror site will be available in Boston the following year. We also hope to establish a site in Europe.
<p> 
The database is intended to contain extensive information about zebrafish stocks, mutants, gene expression patterns, developmental and adult anatomy, and much more. A simple WWW interface will be available for submitting data and obtaining information over the Internet. More details of the proposed system can be obtained at the Eugene WWW site: &lt;&gt;.
