<b>ZEBRAFISH WEB SERVER (SOUTH CAROLINA) CHANGES</b>
<p>
By R. Vogt, Department of Biological Sciences, University of South Carolina,
Columbia, SC 29208, USA (<a href=mailto:VOGT@ZEBRA.SC.EDU>

<p>
	The Zebrafish Web Server in South Carolina has a new name. The University changed the domain name from "scarolina" to "sc". While this change is supposed to be transitional (2 years), please note the change where appropriate. The new address for this server is:
<p>
<b><a href="http://zebra.sc.edu">http://zebra.sc.edu</a></b>
<p>
	Also, I relocated the server from a PC to a Sparc Station. File name
extensions have similarly changed from "htm" to "html". If any of you have
pointers set to a specific file, please note this change.
<p>
	Also, please note that I archive many points of methods from this NewsGroup on the server under "Zebrafish Resources" in "Submitted Methodology"
<a href="http://zebra.sc.edu/methods/miscmeth.html">
(http://zebra.sc.edu/methods/miscmeth.html</a>).
