<b>DELAYED <i>IN VITRO</i> FERTILIZATION OF ZEBRAFISH EGGS USING COHO SALMON (<i>ONCHORHYNCHUS KISUTCH</i>) OVARIAN FLUID</b>
<p>
By G.E. Corley-Smith, C.J. Lim, and B.P. Brandhorst, Institute of Molecular
Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, B.C., V5A 1S6,
CANADA
<p>
	Many experiments that involve <i>in vitro</i> fertilization can be facilitated
by being able to delay fertilization of zebrafish eggs for periods up to a few
hours after they are extruded from the female. For example, when injecting 1-4
cell embryos, the injections could be done in batches that were fertilized at
progressively later times. Delayed fertilization is also required if eggs must
be manipulated prior to fertilization; e.g. for microinjection, nuclear
transplantation, or irradiation to produce haploid or diploid androgenotes.
<p>
	We have held zebrafish eggs for over 6 hours after extrusion from the female;
when subsequently fertilized, they developed into apparently normal zebrafish.
Recently we held 76 zebrafish eggs for 50 minutes between the time the eggs
were extruded from the female and when milt was added to fertilize the eggs. In
this group, 72% were fertilized and developed as normal looking embryos which
hatched. The remaining 28%, observed at 24 hours, showed no embryonic
development and appeared unfertilized. The technique does not appear to lead to
an increased incidence of abnormal development or decreased fertility of
adults. Fish derived from eggs that were held for times exceeding 1.5 hours,
have matured and been used for breeding in our lab.
<p>
	The technique uses the natural body fluid that surrounds mature coho salmon eggs, ovarian fluid. We have successfully used coho salmon and rainbow trout (<i>O. mykiss</i>) ovarian fluid. Our batches of coho ovarian fluid collected in 1991 are more effective than our batches of rainbow trout ovarian fluid. However, Pat Gibbs (Gibbs <i>et al.</i>, 1994) has used rainbow trout ovarian fluid successfully. We suspect that ovarian fluid from any fish species that holds eggs in a mature state for long periods is likely to be effective. Thus, ovarian fluid from any salmonid species is likely to work, although we expect the most effective ovarian fluid to be from species that undergo prolonged upstream migrations to their spawning streams and consequently probably hold their eggs longer.
<p> 
	When coho ovarian fluid containing zebrafish eggs is diluted with water, the
chorions of the eggs rise, and cytoplasmic streaming that leads to formation of
the blastodisks is initiated. Although the blastodisk forms, no cell divisions
take place. Thus, egg activation without insemination is initiated, and the egg
can no longer be fertilized. Very little dilution of coho ovarian fluid is
required for initiation of activation. Increasing the proportion of water
added, up to a plateau, increases the rate of chorion elevation.
<p>
<b>Quality of Ovarian Fluid</b>
<p>
	Care should be exercised in collecting ovarian fluid. For salmon, if a few
eggs are ruptured in a batch of eggs, the subsequent fertilization rate of the
non-ruptured eggs is substantially reduced. Contamination of salmon eggs and
ovarian fluid with blood reduces their subsequent fertilization rate.
Furthermore, dilution of ovarian fluid with water leads to activation of eggs.
Thus, we believe the ovarian fluid must be collected in such a manner as to
reduce contamination by broken salmon eggs, blood and water.<p>

	The female fish from which ovarian fluid is collected should be mature and
ready to deliver eggs but should not be overly ripe with broken eggs and watery
ovarian fluid. Ovarian fluid from non-ripe females may be useable, but the
volume of ovarian fluid will be less.<p>

	We normally collect ovarian fluid at a salmon hatchery. We separate some
ovarian fluid from the salmon eggs and turn the salmon eggs over to the
hatchery staff for fertilization, which is not impaired. Approximately 50 mls
of ovarian fluid can be collected per coho salmon. One good batch of 50 mls is
sufficient for holding the eggs from over 1,000 zebrafish females.<p>

	As batches of ovarian fluid (ovarian fluid from one fish) vary in their
effectiveness for holding zebrafish eggs, we test individual batches of ovarian
fluid. When a batch is identified that allows for holding zebrafish eggs for
1.5 hours with high subsequent fertilization rates, we then aliquot this batch
into 1.5 ml screw cap microcentrifuge tubes and freeze at -20C or
-80C. Coho salmon ovarian fluid is robust and can undergo repeated
freezing and thawing and can be left for several days at room temperature and
still function. However, for optimal fertilization rates we suggest more
careful storage.
<p>
<b>Collection of Ovarian Fluid</b>
<p>
	Coho salmon die shortly after spawning; thus, eggs are normally collected at
hatcheries immediately following lethal cranial trauma. The euthanized female
coho salmon is immediately hung by its tail and all the gills on both sides of
the had are slit to drain blood. Pushing a wad of paper towels under the
operculum will help soak up blood and impede coagulation. After 5 minutes, dry
the fish with a towel so that no water can drip into eggs and ovarian fluid
when they are collected. Have an assistant hold the fish by its head and tail,
with its belly downward over a clean dry bowl, and slit the fish from anus to
from of the body cavity. Eggs and ovarian fluid will fall into the bowl.
Release eggs from skein (ovarian connective tissue) and remove pieces of skein
from bowl containing free eggs and ovarian fluid. Remove 75% of ovarian fluid
to 50 ml conical plastic tube. A non-abrasive kitchen strainer or colander,
stainless steel or plastic, is useful to separate eggs from ovarian fluid.
Handle eggs gently at all times to prevent breakage. Give the salmonid eggs to
hatchery staff and put the ovarian fluid on ice. Back at the lab, centrifuge
the tubes of ovarian fluid at 5500 g for 5 minutes at 4C to
sediment cellular debris. Remove the supernatant and freeze it.
<p>
<b>Use of Ovarian Fluid for <i>In Vitro</i> Fertilization</b>
<p>
	This technique is similar to normal <i>in vitro</i> fertilization as outlined
by Charline Walker and George Streisinger in Eugene's <i><a href="/zf_info/zfbook/zfbk.html">The Zebrafish Book:</a> A
Guide for the Laboratory Use of Zebrafish</i> (Brachydanio rerio). We collect
eggs with silanized capillary tubes (Kimax-51, Kimble Products Art. No. 34502,
ID 0.8-1.1mm, length 100mm) that we pre-wet with ovarian fluid. When eggs are
collected, they are placed into 100ul of salmonid ovarian fluid in a small
petri dish.  The actual volume of ovarian fluid is adjusted to the number of
eggs. All eggs must be covered with ovarian fluid. We get better subsequent
fertilization rates when we hold the eggs at room temperature
(18-22C) than when we hold them chilled at approximately
4C. Immediately before fertilization, we remove most of the ovarian
fluid from the zebrafish eggs with a Pipetman, centrifuge it at 5500g for 5 min
at 4C to sediment cellular debris, and then remove the supernatant
which can be frozen for reuse. Following removal of ovarian fluid, eggs are
fertilized as normally done for <i>in vitro</i> fertilization.<p>

	A step by step protocol for using coho ovarian fluid for delayed <i>in
vitro</i> fertilization is expected to be included in an update to <i>The
Zebrafish Book</i> which is scheduled to be issued later this year.

	We gratefully acknowledge Pat Gibbs and Charline Walker. This technique was refined based on friendly advice received from both. Also, they were both
instrumental in infecting us with their enthusiasm for zebrafish research, and
teaching us the basics of running a zebrafish research facility.
