	We examined developing lineages of central nervous system (CNS) progenitor
cells during gastrulation and early segmentation in the zebrafish embryo, and
observed consistent coupling of specific morphogenetic behaviors with
particular cell cycles.  The cells divide very synchronously.  Their divisions
become progressively oriented, and act synergistically with oriented
intercalations during the interphases of zygotic cell cycles 15 and 16 to
extend a single lineage into a long, discontinuous string of cells aligned with
the nascent embryonic axis.  Convergence brings the string to the dorsal
midline, and once there, the cells enter division 16. This division and
following intercalations convert the single string into a bilateral pair of
strings, one forming a part of each side of the neural tube.  The stereotyped
cellular behaviors appear to account for the previously reported clonal
restriction in cell fate, and to underlie morphogenesis of a midline organ of
proper length and bilateral shape.  Regulation of cellular morphogenesis could
be cell-cycle dependent.
