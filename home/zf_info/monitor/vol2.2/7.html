	The long awaited new edition of the <i>Zebrafish Book</i> is finally ready!
About time, huh?<p>
	It contains expanded versions of chapters from the first edition and a new
chapter on cellular methods, including microinjection, transplantation and
ablation of single cells.<p>
	Like the first edition, the new book is printed in a loose leaf format to make
it easy to update.  We intend the book to be a living document that grows and
improves with time. However, this will require input from you.  Please address
corrections and additions to us.<p>
	An order form is included with this issue of the <i>Monitor</i>.  A special
note for labs outside the US:  we can get a reduced postage rate for large
orders.  So, we encourage you to order all the books you will need for your lab
as a unit, rather than placing several individual orders.<p>
Happy fishing!
