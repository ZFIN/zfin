<b>EXPANDED MIDLINE SIGNALING IN THE ZEBRAFISH ANTERIOR

In all vertebrates the brain develops from the enlarged anterior part of the
neural plate.  However, in the zebrafish mutant  <i>cyclops</i> the girth of
the central nervous system (CNS) is nearly uniform along its length.  Changes
in expression patterns of homeobox genes and neuronal markers reveal that the
entire ventral forebrain is missing, as well as its precursor region in the
neural plate.  The massive deletion is due to a nonautonomous action of the
mutation: as few as one wild-type cell transplanted to the midline of a mutant
embryo, can rescue the forebrain phenotype including cyclopia.  Establishment
of forebrain ventral positional values and size may thus require inductive
signaling by CNS midline cells of a "prefloor plate", whose specification
depends upon the <i>cyclops</i> gene product.
