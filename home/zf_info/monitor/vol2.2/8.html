<b>CHARACTERIZATION OF A CELL LINE DERIVED FROM ZEBRAFISH
(<i>BRACHYDANIO RERIO</i>) EMBRYOS</b><p>

	During the last decade, zebrafish (<i>Brachydanio rerio</i>) have emerged as a
novel and attractive system to study embryogenesis and organogenesis in
vertebrates.  The main reason is that both extensive genetic studies and
detailed embryological analysis are possible using this small tropical fresh
water teleost. However, <i>in vitro</i> analysis using cell culture or
molecular genetics are still far less advanced than in other vertebrate
systems.  <p>
	We report the generation and characterization of a fibroblast like cell line,
ZF4, derived from one day old zebrafish embryos.  The hyperploid cell line has
been stable in multiple passages for more than two years now and is the first
zebrafish cell line that can be maintained in conventional medium containing
mammalian serum.  <p>
	Using a series of plasmids for expression of a marker gene, we evaluate in ZF4
cells the relative strength of expression from several different viral, fish
and mammalian promoters.  Stable integration can be obtained by using G418
selection.  We hope that our cell line will be a useful tool for the analysis
of gene regulation in zebrafish.
