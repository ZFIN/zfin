<H2>BIONET NEWS GROUP ESTABLISHED</H2>
<H3>by Dick Vogt</H3><p>
<p>
7/20/94<br>
To the Zebrafish community... <p>
Our Usenet Internet Newsgroup has passed and is working; its name is bionet.organisms.zebrafish.  I received the following message today; it includes information on how to access the newsgroup directly as well as how to access it via e-mail, if that is preferable.  I will prepare instructions regarding use etc., and get these out soon. However, it is best that you contact someone locally, if possible to help set you up, as there are several different "news readers" and it is difficult for me to know what you have; some news readers are easier to use than others.  If you have specific questions/problems, please contact me directly and I will try and assist you.  I hope you find the interactive format useful.  Please use it anyway you like; we will see how it evolves.  I am officially designated "discussion leader" along with Una Smith, but the "unmoderated" format means that I will be doing very little other than trying to help out where I can.  Feel free to use the newsgroup as a forum for asking questions, asking for assistance, posting info regarding job openings or seekings, posting information regarding events, or in any other manner that seems appropriate.<p>

PLEASE DO NOT SEND SUBSCRIPTION REQUESTS TO THE POSTING ADDRESSES asyou will bother everyone on the newsgroup!!!<p>
How to reply to a message on the group:<p>
If you are using a newsreader, simply use the reply or follow-up command on your newsreader (these vary from program to program) to send either private or public replies.<p>
If you are using e-mail, replies to messages that you receive will *NOT* be automatically returned to the group.  This is the standard for Internet mailing lists as opposed to BITNET LISTSERVs which often send all replies back to everyone.  You must be certain that your reply contains either of the two newsgroup posting addresses above in your message header if you want to share it with everyone on the group.  Otherwise in most cases your reply may go back to only the original poster of the message to which you are replying.<p>
ALWAYS be certain that you examine the address on your messages before you send them!!!  Once a message is sent there is no way to cancel it or bring it back!!!  Some non-Internet compliant mail systems may attempt to send replies to our error-trapping address called BIOSCI-REQUEST.  If yours does this, please be sure to readdress your message to zbrafish@net.bio.net or zbrafish@daresbury.ac.uk if you want to send it to the newsgroup.<p>
How to look at archives of the list:<p>
Archives for ZBRAFISH/bionet.organisms.zebrafish are kept in the anonymous FTP account at net.bio.net [134.172.2.69].  Look in the directory pub/BIOSCI/ZBRAFISH for posting archives.  Each file is assigned a date such as 9312 for December 1993.  Please note that ours is a UNIX system and all file and directory names are case-sensitive, i.e., upper case file names are different from lowercase names. <p>
You can also access these same files via Gopher if you start a gopher session using net.bio.net as your gopher server.  Gopher also allows you to view the individual messages within each monthly archive file. The files are in the ZBRAFISH directory.  Postings to bionet.organisms.zebrafish are also WAIS indexed and can be searched via either gopher or WAIS at our site.  In gopher the option at net.bio.net is "Search Bionet USENET Articles" and in WAIS one should use the WAIS source biosci.src.  This is a WAIS index of allBIOSCI/bionet messages including this newsgroup.  Please see the BIOSCI FAQ for details.  The FAQ can be requested from biosci-help@net.bio.net.<p>
Once again, if you have any administrative questions that require personal assistance, please address them to biosci-help@net.bio.net in the U.S. or biosci@daresbury.ac.uk in the UK.<p>
Best wishes for a successful newsgroup!<p>
                Sincerely,<p>
                Dave Kristofferson,                BIOSCI/bionet Manager,
                biosci-help@net.bio.net<p>
