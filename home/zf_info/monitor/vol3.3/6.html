<H2>PARAMECIA PROTOCOL</H2>
<p>
By R. Kimmel, Institute of Neuroscience, 1254 University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403-1254, USA<p>
<b><u><p>
Seed Cultures</u></b><p>
	<p>
Raise seed cultures in covered petri dishes.  We use 25 x 150 mm Falcon dishes.  To each petri dish, add 175 ml double distilled water, approximately 10 grains of boiled wheat seeds (animal feed wheat or health food store "wheat berries"), one fifth of one seven and a half grain standard brewer's yeast tablet, and approximately 10 mls from a good clean young paramecia culture.  Stack the petri dishes 3 or 4 high and store at 28.5C in a lighted place.  The cultures will be ready to use in two days and will keep for several weeks.  One seed culture will start 10 new seed cultures or five two liter pots for baby fish feed.
<b><u><p>
Standard Paramecia Recipe</u></b><p>
	<p>
Fill each two liter amber mouse cage (actual capacity 2750 ml) with two liters of system water.  To this add approximately 30 grains of boiled wheat, one and one half tablets of brewer's yeast, and one fifth of a petri dish of paramecia seed culture.  Cover and stack the mouse cages and store in the light at approximately 28.5C.  The cultures will be ready to use in four days and will keep for about three weeks.<hr>
