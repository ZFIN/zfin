	This rapid, simple procedure yields DNA and RNA which can both be seen on a
normal agarose gel.  We remove the unwanted nucleic acid with the appropriate
nuclease.<p>

Buffer:
<ul>
<li>100mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)
<li>100 mM EDTA
<li>250 mM NaCl
<li>1% SDS
<li>use RNase free reagents!
</ul><p>
<b><i>You do not need to remove embryos from their chorions.</i></b>
<p>
<b>For a single embryo:</b>
<ul>
<li>Rinse embryo in sterile water.
<li>Homogenize in 10ul of buffer by hand with a sterile pipette tip.
<li>Add 90ul of buffer and homogenize again.
<li>Extract with 50ul of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl-alcohol (50:48:2).  Mix
gently by inversion, centrifuge and collect top aqueous phase.
<li>Extract aqueous phase as above but with 50ul of chloroform:isoamyl-alcohol (24:1).
<li>Add 25ul of NaAcetate 3M pH 7 and precipitate with 200ul of ethanol.
<li>Resuspend pellet in 20ul of TE.
</ul>
<p>
<b>For 5 or more embryos:</b>
<ul>
<li>Rinse embryos in sterile water.
<li>Homogenize in 100ul of buffer by hand with a sterile plastic pestle
<li>Add 300ul of buffer and homogenize again.<
<li>Extract with 200ul of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl-alcohol (50:48:2).
<li>Mix gently by inversion, centrifuge, and collect top aqueous phase.
<li>Extract aqueous phase as above but with 200ul of chloroform:isoamyl-alcohol (24:1).
<li>Add 100ul of NaAcetate 3M pH 7 and precipitate with 800ul of ethanol.
<i>Note: with 5 or more embryos, the nucleic acid precipitate is immediately
visible and can be centrifuged right away.</i>
<li>Centrifuge and resuspend pellet in 20ul of TE.
