	We have identified and characterized zebrafish <i>eve1</i>, a novel member of
the <i>Drosophila even-skipped</i> (<i>eve</i>) gene family.  <i>eve1</i> RNAs
are expressed initially in late blastulae with a peak during the gastrula
stage, at which time expression is confined to ventral and lateral cells of the
marginal zone of the zebrafish embryo. Later, <i>eve1</i> transcripts are
located in the most posterior part of the extending tail tip.  We show that
LiCl, known to dorsalize <i>Xenopus</i> embryos, has the same effect in
zebrafish, resulting in embryos with exaggerated dorsoanterior structures.  In
LiCl-treated embryos, <i>eve1</i> transcripts are completely absent.
<i>eve1</i> is therefore a marker of ventral and posterior mesoderm.<p>
	In the light of its ventroposterior expression domain, the localization of
<i>eve1</i> transcripts was analyzed in <i>spadetail</i> (<i>spt</i>) and <i>no
tail</i> (<i>ntl</i>), two mutants with abnormal caudal development.  In
<i>spt<sup>b140</sup></i> homozygous mutants, there is an accumulation of cells
in the tail region, resulting from inadequate migratory behavior of trunk
somite cells.  These cells, in their abnormal environment, express <i>eve1</i>,
emphasizing the correlation between ventroposterior position and <i>eve1</i>
expression.  In homozygous mutant embryos for the gene <i>ntl</i> (the
homologue of mouse <i>Brachyury</i>, originally called <i>Zf-T</i>), posterior
structures are missing (M.E. Halpern and C.B. Kimmel, personal communication).
While mutant and wildtype embryos do not differ in their <i>eve1</i> transcript
distribution during gastrulation, <i>eve1</i> expression is absent in the tail
bud of mutant embryos during early somitogenesis, indicating a requirement for
<i>ntl</i> in the maintenance of <i>eve1</i> expression.<p>
	Our findings suggest that <i>eve1</i> expression is correlated with a ventral
and posterior cell fate, and provide first insights into its regulation.<p>
