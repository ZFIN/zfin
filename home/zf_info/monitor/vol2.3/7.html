	I produced a zebrafish genomic library last fall, and now feel that this
reagent has been tested enough so that it can be distributed to other
laboratories.  The specifics of the library follow:<p>

	The library was made from genomic DNA obtained from 72 h zebrafish embryos (post-fertilization).  The embryos were from commercially-obtained wild-type fish (Ekkwill Tropical Fish Breeders, Gibsonton, FL).  The DNA was partially  digested with Sau3A to an average size of 20 kb, the first two nucleotides of the Sau3A ends were filled-in, and the DNA was cloned into Xho-1 digested and partially filled-in Lambda Fix II (Stratagene).  The ligation was packaged with Gigapack II XL Packaging Extract (Stratagene), which preferentially size selects for 47-51 kb recombinants (18-22 kb inserts).  A primary library of 1.8 x 10<sup>6</sup> clones was amplified in
SRB/P2 to a titre of 4 x 10<sup>9</sup> pfu/ml.  As of March 1993 the titre had
dropped to 2 x 10<sup>9</sup> pfu/ml.<p>
The supplied phage stock should be amplified in XL1-Blue/MRA
or SRB (Stratagene), or an equivalent strain.  Upon arrival, 70ml of DMSO
should be added per ml of stock, and the library subsequently stored at -70C
and the titre checked.<p>
	I have found that the amplified library contains all genes for which I have
screened, including three separate retinoic acid receptor genes, <i>goosecoid,
noggin, dor3, otx, zhox21, and alpha-tropomyosin</i>.
Inserts have been in the 20 kb size range.<p>
