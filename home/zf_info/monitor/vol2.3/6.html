<H2>A SIMPLIFIED RIBONUCLEASE PROTECTION ASSAY FOR EMBRYOS</H2><p>
By G.M. Kelly and R.T. Moon, Department of Pharmacology, SJ-30, University of
Washington, Seattle, WA 98195<p>
<p>
	We use a ribonuclease protection assay based on the methods of Thompson and
Gillespie (<i>Anal. Biochem.</i> <b>163</b>:281-291, 1987) and Haines and
Gillespie (<i>Biotechniques</i> <b>12</b>:736-740, 1992) to characterize the
expression of various transcripts during zebrafish embryogenesis. This rapid
technique, which eliminates the need to isolate purified RNA, is extremely
sensitive such that an overnight exposure is sufficient to detect a <i>wnt1</i>
signal from ten 12-hr embryos (Kelly and Moon, in preparation).  In addition,
with the generation of a standard curve, this assay can also be used to
determine the abundance of a specific transcript.<p>
	1.  Collect embryos at particular developmental stages in 1.5 ml
microcentrifuge tubes, and remove the medium.  Add 45 ul of lysis buffer (4 M
guanidine thiocyanate, 25 mM sodium citrate and 0.5% sarcosyl) for every ten
embryos.<p>
	2.  Draw embryos and lysis buffer through a 22 gauge needle into a syringe,
expel and repeat three times, then vortex and store at -20C.<p>
	3.  Centrifuge the embryonic lysates for 1 min to pellet the broken chorions.
For hybridization, transfer 45 ul of each sample to tubes containing
1x10<sup>5</sup> cpm of <sup>32</sup>P-UTP-labeled antisense probe diluted in 5 ul of lysis buffer.  Varying the amount of labeled probe may be necessary to optimize signal to background. We prefer the Maxiscript kit available from Ambion (Austin, TX) for making the probes.<p>
	4.  As a positive control and to generate a standard curve, hybridize 45 ul of
lysis buffer containing either 1.0, 0.1, 0.01, or 0.001 ng of synthetic sense
strand RNA with the radioactive antisense probe. Similarly, hybridize the
antisense probe with 45 ul of lysis buffer containing 10 ul of <i>torula</i>
tRNA to ensure that the RNAse will digest any unprotected single-stranded RNA molecules.
<p>
	5.  After an overnight hybridization at 55C, mix the sample with
500 ul of RNAse cocktail (20 ul RNAse A, Sigma R-5503, previously boiled for 5
min, aliquoted and stored at -20C plus 500 U of RNAse T1, Sigma
R-1003, in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl and 5 mM EDTA), and incubate at
37C for 1 hr.  Varying the hybridization temperature may have an
effect of the sensitivity of the assay, we begin at 55C and then,
if necessary, alter the temperature in 5C intervals.<p>
	6.  To isolate nucleic acids after hybridization, digest the lysate with 10 ul
of 20% SDS and 5 ul of 20 mg/ml proteinase K, for 45 min at 37C.
Add Isopropanol (500 ul) and 3 ng of <i>torula</i> RNA to each sample before
centrifuging.  Air dry the pellets, resuspend in 10 ul of loading buffer (88%
formamide, 10 mM EDTA, 1 mg/ml each of xylene, cyanol, and bromophenol blue),
heat at 75C for 4 min, then place on ice before loading onto a 5%
polyacrylamide/urea/taurine gel (details in the Sequenase kit, US Biochemical).
Electrophorese samples next to 2000 cpm of undigested probe and DNA sequencing
reactions to provide size markers, and process the gel for standard
autoradiography.<p>
