<p>To screen for developmentally active chromosomal domains during early zebrafish
embryogenesis, we generated transgenic fish by microinjecting a <em>lacZ</em> reporter construct.  To
screen for transgenic fish, we crossed injected fish (F<sub>o</sub>) to non-injected fish.  Groups of 15 to 20
progeny of each cross were tested for transmission of injected sequences using PCR.  Injections
of a linear reporter construct containing mouse heat shock promoter sequences revealed
transmission of injected sequences to F<sub>1</sub> progeny in about 6% of the cases (8 of 129 fish).

<p>We found one <em>lacZ</em>-expressing line that showed a spatially and temporally restricted expression
pattern of <em>lacZ</em> and, therefore, displays characteristics typical of "enhancer trap" lines.  The
reporter gene, <em>lacZ</em>, is expressed exclusively in primary sensory neurons, including Rohon-Beard
neurons in the spinal cord and trigeminal ganglion neurons in the head.  <em>LacZ</em> expression starts at
16 h (hours post-fertilization) in trigeminal ganglion cells.  At about 24 h <em>lacZ</em> expression can be
detected in trigeminal ganglion neurons and Rohon-Beard neurons.  The reporter gene has
integrated as a single copy.  The founder fish was mosaic: 19% of its offspring (3 of 16 tested
animals) carried the reporter construct in their fins; about 51% (13 of 27 tested animals) of the
progeny of F<sub>1</sub> fish were -Gal positive indicating full hemizygosity.  We traced the inheritability
up to the 4th generation and showed that the reporter construct is stably integrated and inherited
in a Mendelian manner.  These results demonstrate that it is possible to generate "enhancer trap"
lines in zebrafish, albeit with low efficiency.

<p>Our future research interests will focus on cloning the insertion site and generating mutants using
<em>lacZ</em> as a dominant marker in a deletion mutagenesis screen.  To that aim, we already irradiated
several thousand homozygous embryos.  The survivors will be tested for the lack of
<em>lacZ</em>expression.

LABELED PROFILES FOR EM</strong></a></h2>

<p align="center">By Steve Wilson, Division of Biomedical Sciences, Kings College London, Strand, London
WC2B 5RL.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In recent years, lipophilic neuroanatomical tracer dyes, such as diI (Molecular Probes), have
gained favor for many neuroanatomical applications (Honig and Hume, <em>TINS</em> <strong>12</strong>, 333).  One
major advantage is that they can be used on fixed tissue allowing much more accurate
applications of tracer than is often possible in living animals.  A disadvantage to these lipophilic
dyes is that they are fluorescent, making it more difficult to accurately examine labeled profiles
in relation to their environments.  This problem was overcome when it was found that the
fluorescence within labeled profiles could be converted to a permanent brown reaction product
by excitation of the labeled profile in the presence of diamino benzidine (DAB, McConnel et al.
<em>Science <strong></em>245</strong>, 978).  

<p>Recently we, and others, wondered if this photoconverted reaction product would be suitable for
ultrastructural examination.  Indeed it is, and given the right conditions, one can obtain EM
pictures as nice as intracellular fills with HRP.  Below are the methods that we use to get the best
EM preservation.  Nothing in these methods is particularly novel but there are a few helpful hints
for getting the best results.

<p>1.  Fixation.  2-4 hours in 0.1M Pipes (disodium salt) buffer, 2mM EGTA, 1mM MgSO<sub>4</sub> and
3.5% paraformaldehyde (or formalin).  Adjust pH to 6.95 with concentrated HCl.  To this
solution add a few drops of glutaraldehyde to give a final concentration of about 0.1% (this last
step can be omitted if the preparation is not destined for EM).

<p>Although this is an unusual preliminary fix for EM, especially since it contains EGTA, it works
quite well.  I expect that PO<sub>4</sub> buffered fix would also work, although I use the above primarily
because it seems easier to dissect embryos fixed in Pipes than in PO<sub>4</sub>.

<p>2.  Wash in 0.1M PO<sub>4</sub> buffer (pH7.4) and dissect as much as possible to expose the cells that you
want to label.

<p>3.  Dissolve diI in dimethyl formamide (DMF) or some other organic solvent and allow to dry on
glass.

<p>4.  Using a sharp tungsten needle, pick up some of the diI crystals (they stick easily to the
needle).  Put this needle into the bathing solution close to your embryo and using a second
needle, pick off a crystal (I use ones between 5-40, um).  The diI is neutrally buoyant and will
float in the buffer around your embryo.  Using the second needle, move the crystal onto the
cell(s) of interest.  The diI sticks when it touches tissues, so it requires a bit of practice to
position it without error.  Leave the crystal in place for several minutes before moving the
embryo (with care the crystal can be removed after the diI has labeled your cells).

<p>I think that there are a few advantages to using a crystal over injecting liquid diI.  First, it causes
less damage and secondly the DMF in which diI is dissolved is probably bad for EM
preservation.  Obviously you cannot use a crystal if your cells of interest are not superficial.

<p>5. Allow the diI to label your cells.  For EM, I have labeled growth cones that were 150 &#181;m from
the application sites in about 4 hours at room temperature.  The time will depend upon the
duration of fixation and the distance that the diI has to diffuse.

<p>The object of steps 1-5 is to get the
cells as brightly fluorescent in as
short a time as possible.  Others
have obtained good results using
intracellular tracers, such as lucifer
yellow,  and diffusion in living
tissue also works (Simon and
O'Leary, <em>Devel. Biol. <strong></em>137</strong>, 125). 

<p><img src="VOL1ISS4.htg/cvrslp1.gif" width="372" height="217" align="right" >6. Make a slide with a well that can
hold the embryo and can be
coverslipped.  An adequate supply
of DAB (which is a carcinogen) is
necessary, so this requires some inventive slide making to keep DAB on the tissue and off the
microscope.  I use a 64 x 48 mm coverslip onto which two pillars of two or three 22x22mm
cover slips have been glued to form a well which sits between the columns.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><img src="VOL1ISS4.htg/img.gif" width="403" height="211" align="left" >

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>7.  Put the embryo and a drop
of DAB (30 mg in 50 ml of
PO<sub>4</sub>) into the well and place a
coverslip on top.  This cover
slip is held by surface tension
and the whole slide can be
turned upside down without
spilling DAB to allow viewing
of the embryo from either side.  Moving the top coverslip gently allows the tissue to be rotated.

<p>8.  Illuminate the labeled cells in the DAB solution with a compound microscope using the
normal filters for exciting and viewing diI.  The fluorescence fades after a few minutes and a
brown reaction product appears.  As soon as this happens, remove the specimen by adding a drop
of buffer to one side of the well, wash it well, and fix it in 3% glutaraldehyde (buffered to pH
7.2) for 2-3 hours.  Do not photoconvert the profiles too long as this leads to spreading of the
reaction product beyond the labeled cell and gives poor EM.  The reaction product also
intensifies when it is osmicated so even if you can barely see the profiles at the light microscope,
you should have no problem finding them with EM.

<p>This photoconversion is the make or break step.  Two problems tend to arise.

<p>a)  Nothing photoconverts.  Try the following.  Label the cells as brightly as possible, make sure
no extra filters are in the light path, use a strong fluorescence light source and use as high a
magnification (and numerical aperture) as possible.  Allow a longer transport time so that the
profiles get as bright as possible.  Try using fresh DAB and increasing the concentration to
50mg/50ml.  Increase the time allowed for photoconversion.  You also want your tissue to be as
superficial as possible - removing skin and muscle etc. helps.   b)  Everything photoconverts and
the background is high.  Make sure that the DAB is freshly dissolved (or at least not too old). 
DAB frozen as a concentrated solution eventually seems to lose its potency.  Try lowering the
concentration of DAB.  Try lowering background fluorescence by keeping the application site out
of the field of view, and removing the condenser lens (which reflects epi-fluorescence).

<p>7.  Photograph and draw the preparation, then osmicate it (1% for one hour).  After that, use a
standard EM protocol to get the preparation into plastic (Wilson et al.  <em>Development</em> <strong>108</strong>, 121). 
Under a good stereomicroscope you will be able to see the photoconverted cells in the embryo
even after it has been embedded in plastic.  This helps considerably when you try to find the
profiles during sectioning.  Initially, I look for the reaction product in unstained 1 &#181;m sections
because it is easy to pick out against the transparent background.

<p align="center">In press, <em>DNA Cell Biol.</em>Testing cloned promoter regions for their functionality under <em>in
vivo</em>conditions is a non-trivial task.  Thus, regulatory regions are normally investigated with <em>in
vitro</em>systems, for example, for their responsiveness to various factors.  However, information
concerning the temporal and spatial expression pattern within an organism cannot be obtained by
these assays and this normally needs very elaborate generation of transgenic animals.  

<p>Ependymins are synthesized in fibroblasts of the (endo)meninx and these glycoproteins probably
exist in two different forms: as soluble proteins predominant in the cerebrospinal fluid of many
teleost fish and as constituents of the extracellular matrix.  Recently, we made the first successful
attempt to test a cloned 2.0 kb upstream region of the zebrafish ependymin gene for its capacity
to direct transient expression of a reporter gene (<em>lacZ</em>).  After injection of this
ependymin-promoter-<em>lacZ</em> gene fusion into recently fertilized zebrafish eggs, this regulatory
region was sufficient to direct the ependymin-specific 

<p>temporal and spatial expression pattern of the <em>lacZ</em> gene and we observed -gal-actosidase positive
cells exclusively in the meninx starting between day 2 and day 3 post-fertilization.  These results
are in full agreement with the developmental profile of ependymins and previous <em>in

<p>For the future, we hope that this assay, which is technically feasible on a routine basis, will be
suitable for other genes.  Please contact T.A.B. for technical questions of the transient assay and

<p><strong><u>Culture of Paramecia:</u></strong>

<p>1.  Grow paramecia cultures under "cell culture" conditions.   Make passages in a sterile tissue

<p>2.  Use 500 ml or 1000 ml media bottles (e.g., with orange caps) and culture at 28C in the dark,
for example in a cabinet in your fish room.  

<p>3.  Dilute the starter culture (a clear suspension of paramecia) 1:1 with fresh (milky) medium and
incubate with the cap loosened one half turn to provide air.  After 2-3 days the culture will clear
and you should be able to observe clouds of paramecia. 

<p>4.  Expand the culture by diluting it 1:1 with fresh medium.  If you add twice the volume of fresh
medium, it takes about 3 days to clear.  Use clear cultures for harvesting paramecia or store for 3
to 5 days at about 20C. 

<p><strong><u>Long term storage of paramecia:</strong></u>

<p>Use Dryl's solution (1 volume clear culture to 5 volumes Dryl's) to prepare a backup stock in case
the original culture becomes contaminated.  Paramecia live about 10 days in this solution in the

<em>Zebrafish Book</em>). Repeat until all the stock is filtered. 

<p>5.  Refilter the paramecia through fluted circles rinsing with embryo medium until most of the
yellow color has disappeared. 

<p>6.  Collect the paramecia in a clean bottle making sure that the yellow color is gone. Rinse again
if necessary.  Some paramecia pass through the fluted filters. If they are needed for feeding, they
can be collected by filtering through the Whatman No. 1 circular filter.  However, filtering
through a Whatman 1 is very slow.  

<p>7.  Adjust the volume with embryo medium to equal &#189; of the original culture volume.  Store in
darkness at 20C until needed for feeding. 
<h4><u>Brine shrimp</u>:</h4>
When the baby fish are a couple of weeks old, switch from paramecia to brine shrimp for food,
we use Grade 0, platinum label brine shrimp eggs (Argent Laboratories).  These are smaller than
the San Francisco Bay brine shrimp and from the first day of feeding, 90-100% of the baby fish
can eat them.  Grow them according to Argent's instructions.
<h4><u>Feeding Larvae</u>:</h4>
1.  When the larvae have hatched, transfer them into a new dish or beaker and completely
separate them from their chorions.  It is important to remove the chorions to reduce the growth of
fungus and bacteria.

<p>2.  On day 5, transfer larvae into 1000 ml beakers (up to 100 larvae per beaker).  Fill the beakers
with about 200 ml 

<p>of embryo medium.  Feed 5 ml of the paramecium suspension (see above) three times daily on
day 5 and 6, then 10 ml three times daily thereafter.

<p>3.  On day 9 or 10, when the larvae have nice "paramecium bellies", transfer them into
"baby-tubes".  Pour the larvae from a 1 l beaker into each babytube.  At this age, their belly is big
enough so that they will not pass through the mesh. 

<p>4.  Exchange the water and aerate with a Pasteur pipette in the baby-tube attached to an air line. 
One or two air bubbles every second is sufficient because more air will move the water too much
and the fish will have to fight the current. 

<p>5.  Feed 5-10 ml (for 20-100 larvae) of paramecium suspension 3 times per day.

<p>6.  Every second day, change the water with an aspirator, remove dead fish from the baby-tube,
and add about 200 ml of embryo medium.  

<p>7.  Beginning on day 15 to 20, feed the fish with brine shrimp three times a day.  Be sure to
remove dead brine shrimp daily. 

<p>8.  When about 90% of the fish eat brine, transfer the baby-tubes into fish tanks (see Figure).  

<p>9.  Continue feeding the fish 3 times each day for 5 to 10 days with the small size brine shrimp.
In addition feed them each evening with about 10 ml of Spirulina (1 teaspoon of Spirulina slurry
per 200 ml of fish water; Spirulina from Argent Laboratories).  It is unnecessary to clean the
tubes as long as the water flow is adequate.  Fish can stay in these tubes until they are about 4-6
weeks old and are large enough to go into regular tanks.

<p>We have now raised about 100 lines (a total of about 7000 fish) using this schedule.  Survival of
wild types was between 70 and 95% of hatched larvae, and for mutagenized stocks between 60
and 90%.  The fish reached sexual maturity before three months of age (at 3 month, 50-80% of
all crosses within a given stock produced eggs).  Raising fewer fish (20) in a beaker does not
increase survival significantly, but we could obtain sexually mature fish as early as 9-10 weeks.
<h4><u>Construction of baby tubes:</u></h4>
The design of these tubes is based on a simpler version by C. N&uuml;sslein-Volhard from T&uuml;bingen. 
Use acrylic tubes of about 10 cm diameter with 6-7 mm walls and about 15 cm long.  Close one
end of the tubes by attaching a 0.5 mm nylon mesh with silicone glue.  Let the glue dry and rinse
thoroughly.  On the other end of the tube, drill a small hole which allows you to run a small water
line (e.g. 1/4 inch) into the tube.  The hole should be slightly smaller than the water line (e.g.
15/64 inch for a 1/4 inch line) such that the line can not slide out again.  Place a completed baby
tube into a 2000 ml beaker. 
<h4><u>Fish tanks to hold multiple baby-tubes.</u></h4>
The tanks should have overflows or standpipes that maintain the water level at 10-12 cm.  Cover
the bottom of the tanks with a wide mesh or an array of acrylic rods that hold the baby-tubes up
off the bottom so that water and dirt can flow freely through the mesh in the bottom of the
baby-tubes and into the tanks.  Attach the water line from each baby-tube to the water system
pressure line and adjust the water flow to a slow, steady dripping.  We put several baby-tubes
into one tank, and use a manifold (all plastic, e.g. Penplax) to distribute the water to the different
baby-tubes.
