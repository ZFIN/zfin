TALKING</a></strong></h2>

An NIH sponsored workshop, held in Eugene, September, 1990, recommended publication of a
newsletter for improved communication among the growing number of zebrafish labs.

<p>Conference attendees agreed that the newsletter should provide an open forum for recent
scientific updates, announcements and reviews of meetings, requests for materials and methods,
and a 'who's who' section that lists people and projects.

<p>"Hopefully, people will contribute results, even before they are published in journals," suggested
workshop organizer, Joel Schindler.  The newsletter can be great if everyone takes it seriously.

<p>This first issue of the <em>Monitor</em> is being published in Eugene and contains information gleaned
primarily from the Oregon zebrafish community.  It contains a list of all people presently on the
mailing list with their phone and FAX numbers and E-mail addresses.  Please send similar
information to the editor if you are not yet on the mailing list. 

<p>Contributions and suggestions for future editions are encouraged and should be addressed to the
editor.  See the editorial on page 2 for more information.

A recommendation of the NIH zebrafish workshop, was to establish a linkage map of the
zebrafish genome.  Attendees agreed that an efficient method would be to start with a linkage
map of molecular markers.  Mutations and cloned loci can later be placed on the map by simple
crosses.

<p>At least two groups are working on the map.  In Boston, several labs, coordinated by Cliff Tabin,
are planning to obtain funding for mapping using automated methods for sequencing.  They
intend to use DNA from the Oregon AB "wildtype" line.  The Gilbert lab is working on a YAK
library also from the AB line.

<p>On the West Coast, Geoff Duyk has made libraries from the C32 clonal line and is screening for
simple sequence repeats.  He has recruited sequencing

<p>help from the Grunwald and Westerfield labs.  The linkages will be established with help from
the Boston group and from the Berkeley genome facility under direction of Jasper Rine.

"We're going to make your life easier", says David Brumbley, head of the Neuroscience
Technical Support Group at the University of Oregon.  "This electronic bulletin board will be
great for publishing the <em>Monitor</em> and for making information easily available to people around the
world." 

<p>Most people presently use electronic mail (E-mail) and have access to Bitnet, Internet, or one of
the other computer networks.  The zebrafish <em>Monitor</em> will soon have its own node, "Zebrafish@uoneuro.uoregon.edu" or "Zebrafish@uoneuro.bitnet".

<p>Hopefully, people will use this node to contribute information for the <em>Monitor</em> and to request past
issues.  Electronic submissions can be incorporated into future issues of the newsletter very
efficiently.  Requests will be answered and sent by return E-mail.

<p>Another feature of the bulletin board will be direct dial-in.  Users with computer modems can log
onto the board directly by dialing a regular phone number.  They will be greeted by simple
requests that will direct them to the bulletin board.   

<p>The board is a place where users can leave messages or requests and contribute information to
the <em>Monitor</em> or to other users.  Users will have direct on-line access to various data bases
including the complete list of addresses and phone numbers of members of the zebrafish community, the zebrafish literature list, the updated version of <em>The Zebrafish Book</em>, past issues of the
<em>Monitor</em>, and lists of available reagents like antibodies, libraries, and mutants.

<p>The dial-up feature should be ready by July, 1991.  You can find out about it with an E-mail
request or by watching future issues of the <em>Monitor</em>.

Hey, here we are!  What a great day for the zebrafish research community!  We've gotten big
enough to need our own publication.  The community moans in unison, "Oh no, not another
journal."   

<p>But we intend something different.  We see a vision: an open forum for rapid presentation of new
results, for dissemination of new methods and materials, for personal news and announcements,
and most importantly for publishing results of interest only to us!  We see a forum for open
discussion and improved communication.  

<p>Better science will be done more efficiently if we all talk to one another.  

<p>So, pitch in and help.  Read the newsletter and pass it on to your colleagues.  Add your name to
the register if it's not already there.  Contribute information that others should know.

<p>"Yeah, but what do I know that's interesting for the <em>Monitor</em>?", the hushed masses sigh.

<p>Well, how bout the abstract from your paper that was just submitted or accepted?  Don't you
know someone who is moving soon?  Haven't you got a result that's interesting but probably
won't be ready for a full length paper until next year?

<p>We'll do our job, too.  We will publish issues of the <em>Monitor</em> at regular intervals.  We will do our
best to publish 'all the zebrafish news that fit to print'.  We will make a serious campaign to get
everyone on the mailing list.

<p>In future issues we plan to include an updated versions of the Zebrafish Literature reference
database and additions to the <em>Zebrafish Book</em>.

ENGRAILED-LIKE ANTIGENS IN ZEBRAFISH </strong></a></h2>
 

<p>By Kohei Hatta, Ruth BreMiller, Monte Westerfield and Charles Kimmel,  Institute of
Neuroscience, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403, USA 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>We have studied developmental expression of zebrafish engrailed-like (Eng) antigens.  Many cell
types are reproducibly labeled by two antibodies that recognize the Eng homeodomain, 

<p>but other cells are labeled by only one or the other, suggesting a hitherto unrecognized
complexity of Eng proteins.  

<p>Expression patterns vary remarkably according to cell type and location.  In the undifferentiated
primordia of the brain and of each myotome, expression by a stripe of cells spatially subdivides
the primordium at a location where a morphological boundary forms later, suggesting expression
may be required for development of the boundaries.

<p>Supporting this hypothesis, trunk myotomal cells that express Eng are absent in spt-1 mutant
embryos, just where the myotomal boundaries fail to form.  Another pattern is present in rhombomeres, pharyngeal arches, and the pectoral girdle.  In each of these cases, 

<p>cells (neurons, muscle, cartilage) generating a subset of a series of repeated elements selectivity
express Eng. These subsets then form specialized derivatives, suggesting Eng homeoproteins are
involved in determining the specializations.  

<p>Epidermal expression is present in the ventral half of the pectoral fin rudiment, precisely "compartmentalizing" the fin.  Neuronal cells at a certain dorsoventral level in each hindbrain and
spinal cord segment selectively express Eng, suggesting segmental control of neuronal identity. 
Specific expression patterns are observed in taste buds, otic vesicles, and teeth.  

<p>Thus, we propose that eng genes function in diverse cell types in zebrafish, but play selector roles
that can be classified into a few basic types.  <em>Development</em>, in press.
