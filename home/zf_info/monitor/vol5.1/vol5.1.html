<p><strong>Summary</strong>



<p>We describe the isolation of zebrafish Fgf8 and its expression during gastrulation, somitogenesis,

fin bud and early brain development. By demonstrating genetic linkage and by analyzing the

structure of the Fgf8 gene, we show that <em>acerebellar</em> is a zebrafish Fgf8<em> </em>mutation that may

inactivate Fgf8 function. Homozygous <em>acerebellar </em>embryos lack a cerebellum and the

midbrain-hindbrain boundary organizer. Fgf8 function is required to maintain, but not initiate,

expression of Pax2.1 and other marker genes in this area. We show that Fgf8 and Pax2.1 are

activated in adjacent domains that only later become overlapping, and activation of Fgf8 occurs

normally in <em>no isthmus</em> embryos that are mutant for Pax2.1.These findings suggest that multiple

signaling pathways are independently activated in the midbrain hindbrain boundary primordium

during gastrulation, and that Fgf8 functions later during somitogenesis to polarize the midbrain.

Fgf8 is also expressed in a dorsoventral gradient during gastrulation and ectopically expressed

Fgf8 can dorsalize embryos. Nevertheless, <em>acerebellar</em> mutants show only mild dorsoventral

patterning defects. Also, in spite of the prominent role suggested for Fgf8 in limb development,

the pectoral fins are largely unaffected in the mutants. Fgf8 is therefore required in development

of several important signaling centers in the zebrafish embryo, but may be redundant or

dispensable for others.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<p>We report a novel procedure for efficient mutagenesis of zebrafish. This method uses a DNA

cross-linking agent, 4,5',8-trimethyl-psoralen (TMP), which is known to induce small deletions

frequently in <em>Escherichia coli</em> and <em>Caenorhab-ditis elegans</em>. Our pilot screen indicated that the

TMP mutagenesis procedure was efficient. At present, we are using 3 ng/ml TMP to obtain

mutants. The high efficiency of the TMP mutagenesis will allow the isolation of a significant

number of zebrafish mutants in a single laboratory. TMP induces small deletions by nucleotide

excision and recombinational repair of the interstrand DNA cross-links provide a useful marker

for cloning the mutated gene. We have successfully cloned a zebrafish DNA fragment which is

absent in a mutant.



<p>1) Prepare 3 mg/ml 4,5',8-trimeth-ylpsoralen (TMP) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and store in

aliquots at -70o C in the dark.



<p>2) Anesthetize 3-5 males by immersion in tricaine for 1-3 min according to the standard

procedure from <em>The Zebrafish Book</em>.



<p>3) When anesthetized, rinse the fish with system water, wipe and hold the fish upside-down in a

slit in a sponge block.



<p>4) Collect sperm from 3-5 fishes with 20 &#181;l capillary and suspend in 100 &#181;l Hank's saline 

containing 3-30 ng/ml TMP and 1% DMSO. Incubate the suspension which appears slightly

white on ice for 5 min.



<p>5) Drop 10 &#181;l each of the sperm suspension onto a plastic petri dish.



<p>6) Irradiate the suspension through the bottom of the dish (make the thickness 2 mm by placing

the petri cover plate under the dish) at 312 nm and 0.02 J/cm2 with UV transilluminater

(TFL-20M, Vilber Lourmat, France).



<p>7) Transfer the suspension into a new tube on ice.



<p>8) Expel 100 &#181;l of the mutagenized sperm suspension onto eggs, and fertilize <em>in vitro</em> according

to the standard procedure (<em>The Zebrafish Book</em>).



<p>9) Incubate the fertilized eggs at 28.5o C in the dark for 12 h.

<p>Over the past few years, it has become apparent that the zebrafish as a model of vertebrate

development and disease has received increased attention by the scientific community, primarily

because of its value in both experimental and genetic analyses.  While small groups of

researchers have been working with <em>Danio rerio</em> for many years, the increase in the number of

investigators using this model in recent years prompted the NIH to become more involved in

assisting its development. Early in 1997, a workshop, sponsored by several NIH Institutes was

held by members of the zebrafish community to assess the state of the science relating to the

zebrafish as a model genome system.  This group presented a report to the Director of the NIH, in

spring, 1997, with the recommendation to develop the zebrafish system for genetic studies of

vertebrate embryogenesis and disease.  In response to these recommendations, the Director of the

NIH formed the Trans-NIH Zebrafish Coordinating Committee which first met in the fall of

1997. This working group is composed of representatives from most of NIH's Institutes and

Centers having an interest in promoting zebrafish as a research model.  The Committee is

co-chaired by Dr. Josephine Briggs of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and

Kidney Diseases, and Dr. Tyl Hewitt of the National Institute of Child Health and Human

Development.



<p>Activities by this group have been substantial.  The initial effort of this group resulted in a

Request for Applications (RFA) as part of an effort to create resources that will facilitate the

mapping and positional cloning of genes in the zebrafish.  The RFA (DK-98-006) was published

in December 1997, and applications will be reviewed in July 1998.  Successful applications will

be funded by fall, 1998.  This effort is being co-sponsored by 12 Institutes and Centers.



<p>Most recently, the Coordinating Committee published  a Program Announcement (PA), soliciting

investigator-initiated applications using the zebrafish as a model for development and disease

research.   The objectives of this PA are to encourage and promote new and innovative research

and approaches to identify the genes and elucidate the molecular and genetic mechanisms

responsible for normal and defective development using zebrafish. This PA (HD-98-074) was

published in the May 21, 1998 issue of the NIH Guide.  A total of 18 Institutes and Centers are

participating in this endeavor.   Each of the participating Institutes and Centers has interests in

using the zebrafish as a system to understand better particular processes, organs, or diseases.  In

addition, some may be interested in supporting development of methods, either general

techniques or techniques that may particularly apply to their areas of interest.   Please contact the

appropriate program official listed on the PA with questions.  The receipt dates for this PA are

the same as for any R01 application.  The URL of this PA is: 



<p><font color="#0000ff">http://www.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-98-074. html</font>



<p>In addition, Institutes participating in the Coordinating Committee are assisting in the support of

a Zebrafish Resource Center, overseen by National Center for Research Resources, that will act

as a stock center for the maintenance and distribution of zebrafish mutants to the scientific

community as well as to provide state-of-the-art informational resources via the world wide web

(see article, "Zebrafish Stock Center Funded" on page 3 in this issue). 



<p>These initiatives represent one of the most coordinated and unified efforts on the part of the NIH

to support research using a single animal model.  This indicates an appreciation of the

importance of zebrafish as a model for development by the funding components of the NIH. It is

important to understand, however, that the peer review system is another important link in the

funding process.  As the number of applications using zebrafish increases, it is important that

members of the zebrafish scientific community understand the need for them to participate as

reviewers in this system.  Active participation in the review process not only will enlighten their

colleagues using other model systems, but also will ensure that the expertise is available on study

sections for the fair and appropriate review of zebrafish research grant applications.



<p>The Trans-NIH Zebrafish Coordinating Committee will continue to meet on a regular basis.  We

welcome your suggestions, comments and concerns.  Please contact us and let us know how the

<p>In the zebrafish, <em>Danio rerio</em>,we have identified by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel

electrophoresis, complementary keratin blot-binding assay,and immunoblotting, a number of

different type I and type II Keratins. They range from 56 kDa to 46 kDa in molecular mass and

from pH 6.6 to pH 5.2 in isoelectric point. The type II zebrafish Keratins exhibit significantly

higher molecular masses (56 - 52 kDa) compared to the type IKeratins (50 - 48 kDa), but the

isoelectric points show no significant difference between the two keratin subclasses (type II: pH

6.0 - 5.5; type I: pH 6.1  5.2). According to their occurrence in various zebrafish tissues, the

identified Keratins could be classified into "E" (epidermal) and "S" (simple epithelial) proteins.

A panel of monoclonal anti-keratin antibodies was used for immunoblotting of zebrafish

cyto-skeletal preparations and immunofluorescence microscopy of frozen tissue sections. These

antibodies showed differential cytoplasmic expression of Keratins, which not only included

epithelia, but also a variety of mesenchymally derived cells and tissues. It is concluded that

previously detected fundamental differences in keratin expression patterns between higher

vertebrates and a salmonid, the rainbow trout <em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>, are also true for the

zebrafish, a cyprinid. However, in spite of principle similarities, trout and zebrafish Keratins

differ from each other in many details. The present data provide a firm basis from which the

application of Keratins as cell differentiation markers in the well established genetic model

organism, the zebrafish, can be developed. (Supported by the Stiftung Innovation von

<p>Recently, a small group of representatives of the zebrafish research community obtained funds to

establish an International Stock Center for Zebrafish on the University of Oregon campus.  These

include money from the State of Oregon for construction of a new building and a grant from the

NIH (P40 RR12546) for equipment, supplies and operating expenses.  An application to the NIH

for additional construction money is pending review.  



<p>We anticipate that the stock center will be able to receive samples of frozen sperm and various

reagents in the immediate future.  Please contact Pat Edwards (edwards@uoneuro.uoregon.edu)

for information about submitting such materials.  Special arrangements for taking live fish stocks

from labs that are desperate for space may also be possible.  Construction of the new facility will

begin immediately.



<p><strong>Overview</strong>



<p>Zebrafish has emerged recently as a premiere organism to study vertebrate development and

genetics.  Powerful techniques allow efficient generation and recovery of zebrafish mutations

affecting genes that regulate developmental patterning, organogenesis, physiology and behavior. 

The functions of many of these genes are conserved among vertebrate groups.  Thus, analysis of

zebrafish mutations provides insights into gene functions in other vertebrates, including humans.



<p>Ongoing genetic screens have identified over 7,000 mutations; fish that carry them are distributed

among more than 100 laboratories in 28 countries.  The zebrafish research community

desperately needs a centralized facility to preserve and track these stocks and to facilitate their

distribution to researchers.



<p>The Stock Center will have three main functions:  1) It will maintain and make available to the

research community wild-type and mutant zebrafish stocks, frozen sperm, and reagents.  It will

organize genetic markers and maintain the genetic map.  2) The stock center will distribute

information.  It will maintain the ZFIN computer database, accessible via the Internet, publish a

manual for the laboratory use of zebrafish, facilitate communication among zebrafish

researchers, and host visits from researchers to work with stocks or learn techniques to identify

and maintain mutants.  3) The stock center will develop methods to improve zebrafish health.  It

will establish standards and procedures for generating and maintaining healthier more vigorous

strains, characterize endemic diseases, develop methods for disease control and treatment, and

publish a manual of procedures for preventing, diagnosing, and treating zebrafish diseases.



<p><strong>Specific Plans</strong>



<p>The last several years have witnessed an explosion in our understanding of vertebrate

development, largely based on work from a few model genetic organisms.  The zebrafish is the

newest of these model organisms.  Because the basic principles of body patterning appear similar

during embryogenesis of all vertebrates, insights gained from work on embryonic zebrafish will

have implications for human health and disease.  Moreover, research on this organism meets the

intent of the Animal Welfare Act because use of many higher vertebrates can now be replaced by

use of this lower vertebrate. 



<p>Systematic genetic research on zebrafish began at the University of Oregon and for many years

Eugene was the only place it was performed.  Recently, however, international interest in this

organism has grown tremendously (Balter, 1995; Eisen, 1996; Travis, 1996); studies of the

embryology and genetics of zebrafish and the recent identification of many genetic mutations

have led to a dramatic increase in the number of laboratories using this organism to study the

basic mechanisms of vertebrate development.  Currently these genetic stocks are  distributed

among laboratories around the world. To make room for new mutants, laboratories must

discontinue some of their current stocks many of which are permanently lost.  The zebrafish

research community desperately needs a centralized site to preserve and keep track of these

stocks and to facilitate their distribution to researchers, thus supporting and promoting research

opportunities while preventing duplication of effort.



<p>We will construct a facility to maintain wild-type and mutant stocks of zebrafish and to make

these stocks widely available to the international research community.  A stock center is needed

because it can eliminate the requirement of individual laboratories to maintain stocks they are

unable to study, it can provide animals at lower cost than individual laboratories, and most

importantly, it can ensure the highest possible levels of quality and uniformity.  Specifically we

will:



<p>&#168;  1.  <em>Establish a stock center to serve as a central repository for materials and information.</em> We

will maintain healthy stocks of fish and frozen sperm of identified genotypes and make them

widely available to the research community.  We will obtain carriers of mutations from the

research community and breed them to produce new generations.  We will freeze and store sperm

from these carriers.  We will receive and store antibodies, gene probes, and markers used to

identify and analyze wild-type and mutant stocks.  We will receive and organize genetic markers

and maintain the genetic map.  Upon request, we will ship these materials to research laboratories

throughout the world.



<p>&#168;  2. <em>Make information widely available to the research community.</em> We will maintain ZFIN, a

computer database accessible via the WWW of the Internet, with information about the stocks. 

Additionally, ZFIN will provide information about the genetic map, markers, molecular probes,

laboratory methods, developmental staging, embryonic and adult anatomy, and gene expression

patterns.  Electronic links to researchers, laboratories, sources, and publications will be provided

through WWW services.  We will foster an electronic network of communication among

laboratories using zebrafish.  We will publish both hardcopy and electronic versions of a manual

for the laboratory use of zebrafish and a periodical with news about zebrafish research and

techniques.  The stock center will host visits from researchers who wish to work with stocks,

learn techniques, or learn to identify and maintain mutant stocks.



<p>&#168;  3. <em>Develop methods for improving health</em>.  We will establish standards and procedures for

generating and maintaining healthier and more vigorous strains.  We will characterize diseases

endemic to laboratory stocks.  We will study these diseases to identify their sources and causes

and we will develop methods for their control and treatment.  We will publish a manual for the

prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases affecting zebrafish.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<p>The stock center in T&uuml;bingen keeps about 400 mutant lines of <em>Danio rerio</em>, which are publicly

available for scientific research. Most of these mutants in the stock center were isolated in a

screen for embryonic visible phenotypes in T&uuml;bingen between 1992 and 1994. In addition to

mutants with embryonic visible phenotypes, several dominant and recessive adult visible mutants

are kept (Haffter et al., 1996a &amp; accompanying articles; Haffter et al., 1996b). 



<p>From the 1200 mutations that were analysed, the stock center keeps a representative collection as

outbred lines. The mutant stocks include one or more alleles of most of the 371 genes described,

as well as some wild-type and reference strains with visible markers. Most mutants that are

insufficiently characterized and not assigned to complementation groups (termed "unresolved")

are kept only as frozen sperm samples. As a rule these alleles will not be made available. The

collection of mutants kept as live fish in the stock center is in some flux. Current mutations may

be retired as new mutations are discovered. Thus the composition of the collection is changing

slightly with time. 



<p>Standardly, the stock center will ship spawns from mutant outcrosses for the recipient lab to

grow. It is also possible to provide fixed mutant embryos. Because the capacity of the stock

center is limited, it may not be possible to fill all requests. Priority will be given to people who

can grow their own fish. If you have problems raising and keeping extra lines, you might also

spend some time in our lab to carry out the experiments in-house. 



<p>Generally the transfer of living stocks will require you to sign a Material Transfer Agreement

(MTA), which serves to protect the economic interests of the Max-Planck-Institute from

commercial exploitation of the mutant strains. Otherwise there are no restrictions on the research

done with the fish. If you can obtain the requested stocks from another lab closer to you, you

should nevertheless first ask for an MTA form and return it to us. 



<p>If you are interested in receiving mutant stocks, please check our Web Site: 



<p><font color="#0000ff">http://www.eb.tuebingen.mpg.de/abt.3/stockcenter/home.html</font>



<p>for more detailed and updated information. Please contact the stock keeper by email to make

arrangements. Upon return of a signed MTA, we will usually provide outcrosses of identified

carrier fish. We try to obtain two independent outcrosses with about 2 x 70 eggs for each

mutation. In case we manage to get only two batches from the same spawn, one of the batches is

marked as "clone". Outcrosses are usually made against our "wild-type" lines T&uuml;bingen (Tu) and

Tup- Longfin (TL). The latter carries mutations with adult phenotypes in two genes: a weak

allele of leopard (former Tup, leot1) makes the striped pigmentation pattern dissolve into a

spotlike pattern (recessive phenotype), and longfin (loft2) causes the growth of conspicuous long

fins, both in heterozygous and homozygous mutant fish. These two mutations are present in the

background of the majority of our lines. More rarely, some lines contain the golden (golb1)

allele, which reduces the melanin in embryos and adults. Some stocks may contain genetic

backgrounds from the wild-type lines AB or WIK. The spawn will be bleached, some Pronase

will be added to facilitate hatching and the embryos will be sent by UPS (Europe) or Fedex (all

other areas). Please provide us with your complete address (including phone number) and a

second contact email address of someone from your lab, who can receive the embryos in case

you are not around upon delivery. If possible, also provide us with a customer number of the

transport company servicing your area.



<p>The eggs we send, as far as we can tell, are free from disease. Despite these precautions, we

cannot take responsibility for infectious diseases that might be carried with the spawn. Egg

batches of second day layers can not be bleached before the eggs undertake their journey. Those

eggs however will always be explicitly marked as "not bleached". You may state beforehand

whether you are prepared to receive unbleached eggs.



<p>The time required to obtain the mutant lines will mainly depend on whether suitable carrier fish

are available or whether it is necessary to wait for another generation of fish to be identified.

Please indicate if some of the mutants have higher priority for you and are needed more urgently

than others. We will confirm your order, tell you which of the required mutants are immediately

available, and provide an estimate of when carriers of the remaining lines can be expected. If you

order a large number of strains, the entire transfer may take several months. In this case, it will be

useful if you restate by email which lines you still require. Please inform us if you no longer need

the fish you requested or whether you obtained them from another source in the meantime. If

some of the strains you received are not growing well, we recommend that you request a new

batch as soon as possible, because the parents may still be available. When planning to order

strains, you should also take into account that winter is a bad season for shipping eggs. 



<p>Up to now we have sent the MTA document by email and keep a general list of mutations

without information about currently available lines on our website. In the future we plan to make

both the MTA and an updated list of available stocks accessible via the internet.

facilities, where a key element in the design is maximizing the efficiency of available space. Here

objective of identifying the minimal volume required for normal egg production.  The test

chambers were supplied with flow-thru water from a large recirculating, aerated system with

biofilter, etc.  Flow-rate to all chamber sizes was kept uniform at 70 ml/min, so that all chambers

received the same degree of dilution of metabolic wastes. Water volume turnover was very high,

ranging from 8 to 42 per hour. Water quality parameters were monitored and found not to differ

significantly among the various chamber sizes. Six adults (2 males and 4 females) were tested in

chamber volumes of 500, 400, 300, 200, and 100 ml, and compared to a control volume of 3.5 l.

Eggs were removed from the test chambers after spawning and incubated in petri dishes at 28oC. 

Total egg production, percent of eggs hatching, and larval length at 96h were used to evaluate

breeding success. Egg production was not significantly affected by reduced aquaria volumes of

500, 400, and 300 ml compared to the control.  However, mean egg production from a test

volume of 200 ml was only 48% of the control egg production (P&lt;0.05), and at a test volume of

100 ml, egg production was reduced to 26% of the control value (P&lt;0.005). Percent egg hatch

and 96h larval length were unaffected at any test volume.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<p>In the past we have noticed an intermittent high fish mortality among young larval zebrafish. Our

daily monitoring of conditions has implicated vicious predators, known as "<em>Twirlies</em>" at the

University of Oregon, to be the cause of much of this larval death.  Over the years they have been

rumored to kill entire stocks of 4-7 day old zebrafish babies.  



<p><img src="COLEPS.GIF" align="bottom" >

<h5><strong>Figure 1</strong> The first picture is a drawing of an individual Coleps. The series of 4 photos (right to left)

shows the fate of two zebrafish larvae confined in a small volume of water from a Coleps culture.

The first picture shows a recently killed zebrafish surrounded by a halo of Coleps (small dots).

After 45 minutes (second picture), the fish in the first frame has been processed to a mere shadow

of its former self (dead fish on left) and a live larva, 5 days old, has been added. The next 2 pictures

are after 15 and 20 minutes. During this period, the larvae has been killed and is in the process of

being eaten by a large swarm of Coleps while the first fish has become increasingly ghost-like.</h5>

To better characterize the problem, we have recently identified the 'twirlies' as <em>Coleps</em>, free-living

freshwater protozoa (Patterson, 1996). They have barrel-shaped bodies approximately 50-80 &#181;ms

in length that are reinforced by a layer of calcareous plates (Figure 1). <em>Coleps </em>are regarded as

scavengers with a preference for dead or dying tissue as well as rotifer eggs (Patterson, 1996;

Jones &amp; Hollowday, 1992). Occasionally we find these predators in fish water and especially in

our paramecia cultures. In small quantities they seem to be relatively harmless, but in

concentrated numbers they can be deadly to small larval fish. As soon as the larvae hatch, the

<em>Coleps </em>are immediately attracted to them. Within a few minutes baby zebrafish can be swarmed

by hundreds of <em>Coleps</em>. It then takes this swarm only between 30 minutes and an hour to kill and

completely consume the baby zebrafish leaving virtually no evidence of their heinous act (see

figure). Rather than a disease or parasite we consider this an infestation of a microscopic

predator.



<p>We found that <em>Coleps</em> were being inadvertently concentrated when we used a 23 &#181;m mesh to

harvest the paramecia for feeding 4-9 day old babies. The <em>Coleps</em> were eliminated from the

paramecia cultures when the fish water used to make up the cultures was sterilized by passing it

through a 142 mm glass filter and a 0.2 &#181;m membrane filter.  This alone has almost entirely

eliminated our <em>Coleps</em> problem.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<p>Members of the serine/threonine phosphatase 2C (PP2C) family have been shown to be

components of a diverse range of signal transduction pathways, including pathways that regulate

sex determination in <em>C. elegans, </em> hormone responses in <em>Arabidopsis</em>, and osmotic balance in

yeast.  We have cloned three putative PP2C homologues from zebrafish using a PCR-based

approach.  One homologue is 80% identical to mammalian PP2C-alpha and another homologue

is 74% identical to mammalian PP2C-beta.  Recent experiments suggest that mammalian alpha

and beta PP2C's may be involved in phototransduction.  The third homologue is 52% identical to

the bovine pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP).  We have examined the expression of the

zebrafish PP2C homologues using Northern analysis.  The homologue with greatest similarity to

the mammalian PP2C-beta shows expression of a 2.0 kb transcript in both male and female adult 

zebrafish.  Interestingly, the homologue with the greatest similarity to PDP shows expression of a 

1.9 kb transcript in female adult zebrafish, but no transcript is detected in male adult zebrafish. 

The same expression pattern is supported by RT-PCR experiments.  The expression of the PDP

homologue in females only suggests that it is involved in a sex-specific pathway.  Based on

previous findings we hypothesize that it may also have a role in sex determination or

differentiation.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<p>A bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway is implicated in dorsoventral patterning

in <em>Xenopus</em>.  Here we show that three genes in the zebrafish, <em>swirl</em>, <em>snailhouse</em>, and

<em>somitabun</em>function as critical components within a BMP pathway to pattern ventral regions of the

embryo.  The dorsalized mutant phenotypes of these genes can be rescued by overexpression of

<em>bmp4</em>, <em>bmp2b</em>, an activated BMP type I receptor, and the downstream functioning <em>Smad1</em> gene. 

Consistent with a function as a BMP ligand, <em>swirl</em> functions cell non-autonomously to specify

ventral cell fates.  Chromosomal mapping of <em>swirl</em> and cDNA sequence analysis demonstrate that

<em>swirl</em> is a mutation in the zebrafish <em>bmp2b</em> gene.  Interestingly, our analysis suggests that the

previously described non-neural/neural ectodermal interaction specifying the neural crest occurs

through a patterning function of <em>swirl</em>/<em>bmp2b</em> during gastrulation.  We observe a loss in neural

crest progenitors in <em>swirl/bmp2b</em> mutant embryos, while <em>somitabun</em> mutants display an opposite,

dramatic expansion of the prospective neural crest.  Examination of dorsally- and

ventrally-restricted markers during gastrulation reveals a successive reduction and reciprocal

expansion in non-neural and neural ectoderm, respectively, in <em>snailhouse</em>, <em>somitabun</em>, and

<em>swirl</em>mutant embryos, with <em>swirl/bmp2b</em> mutants exhibiting almost no non-neural ectoderm. 

Based on the alterations in tissue specific gene expression, we propose a model whereby

<em>swirl</em>/<em>bmp2b</em>acts as a morphogen to specify different cell types along the dorsoventral axis.

<p align="center">By E. Doerry, Department of Computer and Information Science, 1202 University of Oregon,

Eugene, OR 97403-1202



<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<p>Stop and think about how you do research today. How much time do you spend tracking down

information on mutations, genes, researchers, publications, supplies, materials and so on?  How

much time do you invest in keeping abreast of new developments, e.g., scanning publications and

networking with colleagues? How often have you been frustrated by the lack of timely, accurate

information?  



<p>You'll probably discover that you spend a surprising amount of time on these kinds of

<em>information retrieval and integration</em> tasks. One reason for this is that information relevant to

zebrafish is scattered across a variety of media, ranging from huge general-purpose databases like

MEDLINE and GenBank to dusty lab notebooks in the archives of individual labs.  



<p>The goal of the ZFIN database is to bring together these many disparate kinds of information in

an easily-accessible, highly-integrated format.  The ZFIN database has been publicly accessible

for nearly a year now; many of you have probably used it at least once or twice to find

information on zebrafish publications, researchers and labs. This archive of 'community

information', however, represents only a small fraction of the information that will soon be

accessible through ZFIN.  During the past year, we have been working very hard to design

efficient interfaces and upload and organize a variety of experimental data, primarily centered

around zebrafish mutations and genetic maps.  Thanks to the energy and commitment of

information producers at zebrafish labs around the world, this effort is approaching fruition.  A

ZFIN component cataloguing information on mutations is currently in beta-testing and should be

available by the end of June and a component devoted to zebrafish genomics will become

publicly accessible by the end of the summer.  For the longer term, we are developing tools for

searching and viewing a graphical anatomical atlas and staging series, and for performing more

advanced genomic analyses. 



<p>Although ZFIN is divided conceptually into the distinct components mentioned above, our goal

is to integrate them tightly and seamlessly within an interface that is so easy to use that it has no

user manual and requires no special training.  Thus, a researcher with a new mutant will be able

to search for mutations with similar phenotypes, examine the genetic map to find candidate genes

(including potential conserved syntenies from other species), read the abstracts of relevant

publications, and contact the labs and researchers that produced the related mutants or mapping

information all within a single ZFIN session. 



<p>One of the most novel aspects of ZFIN is that it is designed to be a true <em>community database</em>,

directly supported and maintained by the research community.  Unlike databases for other

species, which primarily rely on an army of data editors to extract and enter information from

publications, ZFIN will allow researchers to submit their experimental results directly.  This

paradigm has a number of advantages: information can be updated and disseminated almost

instantaneously; researchers can make available all of their experimental results (e.g., images of a

mutation) rather than the small fraction allowed by journal articles.  The idea of user-submitted

data,  particularly prior to publication, is clearly quite controversial.  Our goal in designing ZFIN

is to find ways to accommodate the social realities of the science explicitly within the design,

while at the same time challenging the community to find ways to accommodate this new

information-sharing paradigm.



<p>Another novel feature of ZFIN is that, as a community database, its goal is to support not only

the information archiving and retrieval capabilities traditionally associated with scientific

databases, but also the informal critique, discussion, and information exchange that lies at the

heart of modern scientific research.  For instance, we are experimenting with "data

commentaries" that allow researchers to attach critique or commentary to data records; other

researchers may respond, attaching their own comments and critique. These mini-newsgroups

provide a focused, searchable record of the critical discussion related to a specific data item,

allowing researchers to survey current issues quickly and join the discussion. It will also be

possible to "tag" data records or abstract queries so that automatic notifications are sent when the

data record or query result changes in the future.  Finally, we are developing a shareable

laboratory notebook for documenting interactions with ZFIN and discussing them with

colleagues.



<p>In sum, we see ZFIN as a resource that will change the nature of zebrafish research, reducing the

amount of effort spent chasing data and bringing together a geographically distributed

community.  But we can't achieve this goal without your help. Your comments, critique, and

suggestions are crucial in our effort to make this a truly useful and 'user-friendly' resource. Please

<h3><strong>Zebrafish Discussion Group</strong></h3>

(bionet.organisms.zebrafish)



<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<p>The zebrafish news group is an on-line discussion group for those



<p>interested in zebrafish research.  You can access it through most



<p>programs that you use to access the World Wide Web (WWW)



<p>such as Netscape or Internet Explorer.  There is also a link to it



<p>from the Zebrafish Information Server.



<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4>Posting messages</h4>

To post a message or question to the news group, select: 



<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<p>bionet.organisms.zebrafish 



<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<p>from the list of news groups. Click on the "New Message" or "Send



<p>Message" button and a screen will appear that looks like an e-mail



<p>send screen with the news group address already inserted onto the



<p>"To:" line.  Type in your message and remember to put a subject on



<p>the reference line.  Send it as you would an e-mail message.



<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<p>Since the news group is moderated to filter out "spams" or



<p>unrelated and unwanted messages, it will go first to the news group's



<p>moderator (currently Pat Edwards) who will then forward it to the



<p>full subscription list.  It also will be posted at the



<p>bionet.organisms.zebrafish site for those who are browsing the list. 



<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4>Subscribing</h4>

To subscribe to the news group so that the incoming messages



<p>automatically come to your e-mail address, you will need to send an



<p>e-mail message to the following address: 



<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<p>biosci-server@net.bio.net 



<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<p>Include the words "subscribe zbrafish" in your message.  (Note that



<p>the "e" in "zebrafish" is not used.)  No other message needs to be



<p>included... just "subscribe zbrafish" without the quotation marks.



<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4>Responding to Posted Messages</h4>

If you wish to reply to a message, you may opt to either reply to the



<p>sender directly or allow your reply to go to the whole group so that



<p>others interested in the same subject can benefit from your



<p>response.  You are strongly encouraged to respond to messages that



<p>are of interest to the whole group via the group option.



<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4>Unsubscribing</h4>

If you no longer wish to automatically receive the news group



<p>postings, you may "unsubscribe" in the same way that you subscribed



<p>to the same address (biosci-server@net.bio.net).  To unsubscribe,



<p>however, you would type in the words "unsubscribe zbrafish" within



<p>the body of your message.
