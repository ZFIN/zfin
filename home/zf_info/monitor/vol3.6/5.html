	The 1996 Singer Symposium will be a satellite of two international conferences, "Limb
Development and Regeneration" (organized by M. Maden, March 25-28, 1996) and
"Regeneration, Growth and Pattern" (Spring Meeting of the British Society for Developmental
Biology organized by V. French and J. Slack, March 27-30, 1996) both to be held at the
University of York, which is about two and a half hours from London by rail.<p>
