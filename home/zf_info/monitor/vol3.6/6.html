<h3>CONSTRUCTION OF ZEBRAFISH SPAWNING CAGES</h3>
<p>

<p>

	We have received several requests for detailed instructions for construction of durable,
autoclavable, economical spawning cages, which we summarize here.  We use a design similar to
one described by Solnica-Krezel et al. (<i>Genetics</i> 1994, <b>136</b>:1404).  The end-product is an opaque
cage with a wire-mesh bottom, placed inside of a transparent cage.  As the fish spawn, eggs drop
through the mesh to a space in the outer cage that the adults cannot reach.  <p>

	Tools required include pliers, glue gun, medium steel shears, hotplate stirrer, large file, razor
blade, and carbide-tipped blade on a table saw.  Materials include stainless steel wire mesh
(McMaster-Carr, 9226T79; 8 x 8 per inch),  9 3/8 x 5 7/16 x 5 1/8" polycarbonate (Nalgene
6602277) and polypropylene (Nalgene No. 6621177) animal cages.  Melt the plastic to the mesh
in a fume hood, in case of smoke.<p>

<p>

The steps: <p>

<p>

1) Slowly and precisely remove the bottoms of the polypropylene cages using a carbide-tipped
blade on a table saw. <p>

<p>

2) Remove large burrs with the razor. <p>

<p>

3) Create a template and cut wire-mesh bottoms from the stainless steel mesh using sheet metal
shears.  The edges of the mesh should meet the outer edges of the cage walls for a proper fit.  <p>

<p>

4) With a hot glue gun, temporarily glue the wire-mesh to the polypropylene cage bottom in
about six places.  We suggest liberal glue application in six spots: in the middle of one of the
shorter sides, and 3-4 cm. away from each corner along the long sides.  Excess glue provides a
handle for subsequent glue removal.  <p>

<p>

5) Melt the wire-mesh into the bottom of the polypropylene cage on the unglued end using a
hotplate.  We use a Corning PC-320 hotplate stirrer at a setting of about 4, and hold the cage at
both sides at an angle of  approximately 30 .  Softening of the plastic proceeds from the edges
towards the middle; continue to press down until the two flows meet.  Cooling may be
accelerated on a cold surface.  When a lip of melted plastic forms on the outside edge of the cage,
one can push the plastic over the edges of the wire using a flat tool.  <p>

<p>

6)  Melt the other sides one half length at a time, removing the temporary hot glue beforehand
(remaining glue will smoke).  <p>

<p>

7) File protruding sharp edges towards the cage openings to prevent dislodging the mesh from
the cages.<p>

	While using these cages for spawning zebrafish during the past three years, we have found that
plastic "greens" appear to miminize trauma by providing refuge, and cloth covers help to
minimize distraction of the fish by lab personnel.<p>
