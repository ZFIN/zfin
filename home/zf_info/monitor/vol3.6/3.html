	Although zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) has many advantages over other organisms for studies in
developmental genetics (1, 2), certain well-developed methodologies for genetic analysis are
lacking. Repetitive sequences in general, and transposable elements in particular, have been
found in all metazoan genomes in which they have been sought (3). Transposons have many
potential applications in genetic research and are routinely used for insertional mutagenesis, gene
mapping, gene tagging and gene transfer in other well-established model systems. These
methods, once developed for zebrafish, would greatly facilitate the identification and mapping of
genes involved in vertebrate embryogenesis and to investigate the evolutionary processes that
have been shaping eukaryotic genomes (4, 5). Accordingly, we decided to characterize repetitive
elements from zebrafish.<p>

	The first repetitive elements characterized in the zebrafish genome were the AluI repeats (6, 7).
These satellite-like, high copy-number elements form long, tandem arrays. They come in two
types. Type I is A+T-rich and composes 5-8% of the zebrafish genome whereas Type II is
G+C-rich and composes about 1% of the <i>Danio rerio</i> genome. Both types are highly
polymorphic, are suitable for identifying individuals within a species, and can be used for
mapping genes and other DNA sequences. We attempted to use these sequences to enhance
integration of transgenic DNA constructs through homologous recombination, but were
unsuccessful (6). Therefore, we investigated two other types of repetitive elements that are
mobile in genomes, elements that move directly through DNA copies and elements that
transpose through an RNA intermediate, retroposons. Figure 1 shows the various families of
repeated sequences that have been found in zebrafish; microsatellite (simple) sequences such as
poly(A) and TG/CA sequences are not shown or discussed. We use the terms "transposon" and
"retroposon" if the respective element has structural and/or sequence characteristics of known
and active transposable elements, regardless of whether the particular sequence has been shown
to transpose in the laboratory.<p>

	We first examined Tc1-like transposable elements (TCEs) which had been identified and
characterized in salmonid fish species and zebrafish (8). TCEs transpose directly via a DNA 
intermediate, similar to P elements and hobo from <i>Drosophila</i>. In nematodes, Tc1 is widely used
for insertional and deletional mutagenesis, transposon-tagging and enhancer trapping. In an
attempt to employ such an element in zebrafish for the same purposes, we characterized the
zebrafish Tdr1 element (9). Tdr1 was successfully amplified about 1000-fold in the zebrafish,
constituting a little less than 0.1% of the haploid genome. However, all of the isolated copies
isolated so far (and the search has been intensive) are mutated and do not encode an active
transposase. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the zebrafish genome contains multiple TCE
families, e.g., Tdr2 (10). Analysis of several copies of Tdr1 and TCEs isolated from other fish
species (10) helped us to reconstruct a consensus sequence of a fish TCE transposase gene
which, when expressed as a protein, has many of the known enzymatic activities of the
transposases (11). The synthetic Tc1-like element should prove useful as an efficient vector for
delivery of transgenes as well as for insertional mutagenesis and enhancer/promoter trapping and
gene mapping.<p>

<img align="left" src="fig1.gif">	We have identified a third family of repeated elements in the zebrafish genome, the  DANA
elements (12). DANA is a retroposon (retroelement) that lacks long terminal repeats and
apparently transposes by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate. DANA is specific for the
genus Danio, and was the first retroposon isolated from zebrafish. DANA exhibits all the
hallmarks of a tRNA-derived SINE (<u>sh</u>ort <u>in</u>terspersed element). In contrast to generic SINE
elements, DANA appears to have been formed by insertions of short sequences (Cv blocks in
Fig. 1) into a progenitor, tRNA-derived element, and amplified further as a transposable unit.
DANA can be particularly suitable as a genetic marker because it has high copy-number
(comprising about 10% of the zebrafish genome), has an apparently random distribution in the
genome, and has a Mendelian segregation pattern suggesting that the elements are stable in the
genome. With DANA-specific PCR-primers (12), the method of SINE-PCR (13) can be used for
genome mapping, fingerprinting and YAC cloning. Association of DANA with
microsatellite-like repeats permits the combination of SINE-PCR and microsatellite marker
mapping (13). "DANA-PCR" can be employed in combination with RAPD markers (14) for
genetic and phylogenetic analyses.<p>

	Transposable elements are capable of inserting into each other to form composite elements that
can be amplified. Evidence for one such event has been found in zebrafish; a DANA-related
element apparently inserted into another sequence that subsequently was amplified and inserted
into the zebrafish ntl  gene (15). The particular composite element that integrated into the ntl
gene is amplified about 80- to 100-fold in the genome (16), although the mechanism by which
the element spread is not known. Other, unidentified, composite elements surely exist in the
zebrafish genome; their structures and modes of amplification remain to be determined. Their
importance is demonstrated by the observation that the DANA-composite element is responsible
for one of only three spontaneous phenotypic mutants that have been characterized at the
sequence level.<p>

	A fourth type of repeated element, named Oops (17), has been found in the zebrafish genome.
Oops is a short repetitive  sequence with the potential to form a cruciform structure. These
fold-back-like elements, similar to the Tourist/Stowaway families, have heretofore been found
only in fungi and plant genomes (18). Oops was found to accompany other repetitive elements
such as DANA, thereby forming complex structures. Oops is found in and around expressed
genes such as growth hormone, eIF-4E, and ntl. Like other repeated elements (19), Oops may be
able to influence expression of nearby genes.<p>

	In conclusion, about 15-20% of the zebrafish genome has been characterized in terms of several
types of repeated elements. Understanding the dynamics and evolution of these sequences will
allow us to harness them, or derivatives thereof, for further genetic manipulations and analyses in
zebrafish.<p>
