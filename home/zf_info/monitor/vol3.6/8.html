	You are cordially invited to participate in the 2nd biennial meeting on Zebrafish Development
and Genetics, which will be held at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. The meeting will begin with
dinner and the first session on the evening of Wednesday, April 24, and will conclude with lunch
on Sunday, April 28. The meeting is devoted to research on zebrafish and will focus on the
cellular, molecular, and genetic regulation of embryonic development and growth, with sessions
devoted to the following topics and chaired by:<p>

<p>

 <b>	Epiboly and gastrulation: </b>Mary Mullins, Max-Planck-Institut fur Entwicklungsbiologie<p>

 <b>	Inductive interactions:</b> Christine Thisse, Institut de Genetique et de Biologie, CNRS <p>

 <b>	Morphogenesis:</b> Charles Kimmel, University of Oregon <p>

 <b>	Pattern regulation:</b> Denis Duboule, University of Geneva <p>

 <b>	Neural crest and head development:</b> Judith Eisen, University of Oregon <p>

 <b>	CNS development:</b> Steve Wilson, King's College London, United Kingdom <p>

 	<b>Blood, heart, and intermediate mesoderm:</b> Mark Fishman, Massachusetts General Hospital <p>

 	<b>Genetic mapping and cytogenetics:</b> John Postlethwait, University of Oregon <p>

 	<b>Gene transfer, gene expression and new methodologies:</b> Nancy Hopkins, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology<p>

<p>

	The format of the meeting will include morning and evening sessions consisting of short talks,
strictly limited to no more than 10 slides and 10 - 15 minutes each including discussion,
principally on unpublished work. Oral presentations will be selected by the organizers in
consultation with the session chairs from the submitted abstracts. The other submitted abstracts
will be presented in poster sessions in the three afternoon sessions. As usual at Cold Spring
Harbor meetings, all abstracts of both poster and platform sessions will be published in an
abstract book given to all participants. <p>

	Abstract and registration materials are available from the address below or can be downloaded or
printed from the Cold Springs Harbor WWW site at <a href="http://www.cshl.org">http://www.cshl.org</a> (under Meetings and
Courses). The submission of an abstract is not required for attendance. The abstract deadline is
February 7, 1996. In order to make the abstract book more useful, we wish to provide an index.
Please choose the three most appropriate keywords and type the corresponding numbers at the bottom
of your abstract in a separate area outside the main body of your abstract. We are especially eager
to have as many young people as possible attend since they are likely to benefit most from this
meeting. To assist them, we have applied for funds from government and industry that we hope
will allow us to provide at least partial support for the attendance of graduate students and
postdocs. <p>

<p>

	We look forward to seeing you at Cold Spring Harbor.<p>
