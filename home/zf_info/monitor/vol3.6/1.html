<h3>HOW YOU CAN HELP BUILD THE ZEBRAFISH DATABASE</h3>
<p>

A group of us were appointed at the 1994 Cold Spring Harbor meeting on zebrafish genetics and
development, to establish an on-line database of information for zebrafish researchers. We have
obtained funding from the National Science foundation and The Zebrafish Database Project is
underway. We are currently in the process of implementing the database which will run over the
Internet. We need two kinds of help:<p>

<p>

1. We ask that you help us with this project by making suggestions for the kinds of data that will
be included in the database.<p>

<p>

2. We hope you can tell us how you use the current Fish Net WWW server
<a href="/">http://<!--|DOMAIN_NAME|--></a> and what sort of things you would like to be able to do with an on-line
database.<p>

<p>

Please send suggestions to either Monte Westerfield <a href="mailto:monte@uoneuro.uoregon.edu">monte@uoneuro.uoregon.edu</a> or
Wolfgang Driever <a href="mailto:driever@helix.mgh.harvard.edu">driever@helix.mgh.harvard.edu</a>.<p>

<p>

Thanks for your help.<p>
