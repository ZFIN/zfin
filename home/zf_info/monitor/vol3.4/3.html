<b>HOLES IN THE FISH NET?</b>
<p>
 <I>(Editorial)</I>
<p>
 Hey!  Once again we need your help.
<p>
 The zebrafish WWW server, "The Fish Net", is entering its 8th month of operation. Use has steadily increased and presently we receive more than 1000 logins per week.
<p>
 We're gratified to see the Net used so extensively.  But at the same time, we need more feedback from you.  We know that these files must contain at least a few mistakes.  You know, those annoying typos like "zebrafinch" instead of "zebrafish".
<p>
 Ensuring the quality of information in the Fish Net is your responsibility, too.  If you see mistakes, let us know.  If there is important stuff missing (like a reference to your most recent article), send us an e-mail.  If you have information to contribute, send us a copy.
<p>
 We hope to upgrade the hardware in the near future.  This will provide faster access and, hopefully, better service in general.
