 The ZEBRAFISH GROUP at Neurobiology, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, has an open position for a GRADUATE STUDENT or a POST-  DOCTORAL FELLOW with interest in cellular and molecular aspects of neuronal development and regeneration. We have recently identified zebrafish homologues of the mammalian cell adhesion molecule L1, the extracellular matrix molecule tenascin, and AMOG (the cell adhesion molecule on glia). The distributions of these molecules are being mapped and their functions will be studied by experimental manipulations (at the protein and at the message levels). Efforts are also underway to identify additional cell recognition molecules in the zebrafish. One goal is to understand how these molecules control the cell-  cell and cell-  substrate interactions which determine regional identity and the patterns of axonal outgrowth in the embryonic CNS. These studies take advantage of the fact that the embryonic zebrafish CNS is relatively simple and very well characterized. Because the adult fish CNS displays an astonishing regenerative capacity it also offers a unique opportunity to address a second goal, to study the role of cell recognition molecules as facilitators of axonal regeneration.
