<title>ZF Monitor Vol 3(4)</title>
<H2>The Zebrafish Science Monitor Vol 3(4)</H2>
<b>LECTURESHIP IN DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY</b>
<p>
 Department of Biological and Molecular Sciences, 
<p>
 University of Stirling, Scotland, UK
<p>
 	Applications are invited for a Lectureship in Developmental Biology within the Department of Biological and Molecular Sciences. This post, on the Lecturer A scale (14756 to 19326 ppa), is available under a "new-blood" scheme, from August 1, 1995. The successful candidate will be expected to mount a strong research program involving modern molecular biological approaches. Although candidates with a background in any of the major developmental model systems will be considered, the ability to interact with the marine biology research group within the department would be an advantage.  Applications (two copies) in the form of a curriculum vitae, supported by a statement of proposed research, and with the names of three referees attached, should be submitted to the Staff Office, University of Stirling, Stirling, FK9 4LA UNITED KINGDOM, by January 31, 1995, from whom further particulars are available.

 	This post, on the Lecturer A scale (14756 - 19326 ppa), is available under a "new-blood" scheme (as a replacement for a retiring member of staff), from 1st August 1995. It is essential that the candidate be in post by October 1, 1995. The placing on the scale will be dependent on age and experience. The position is available for 5 years in the first instance, with anormal expectation of permanency beyond that period.
<p>
 	The successful candidate will be expected to mount a strong research program involving modern molecular biological approaches.
<p>
 	The Department of Biological and Molecular Sciences is a multi disciplinary department, which encompasses 4 main research areas: marine biology, ecology, molecular and cell biology, and chemistry.  The interests of the staff are shown on the attached sheet.  The candidate to be appointed to the present vacancy must be able to interact with the molecular and cell biology group, and is likely to work in association with the marine biology group.  For example, a candidate researching developmental biology of zebrafish, using molecular biological techniques, might be considered appropriate, but those with experience in any of the major developmental systems will be considered.
<p>
 	Applications (two copies) in the form of a curriculum vitae, supported by a statement of proposed research, and with the names of three referees attached, should be submitted to the Staff Office, University of Stirling, Stirling, FK9 4LA, UNITED KINGDOM by January 31, 1995.  It is anticipated that interviews will be held during March 1995.
<p>
 	Informal enquiries may be directed to the Head of Department, Dr. D.S. McLusky on 44-1786-467755 or dsm2@stirling.ac.uk.
