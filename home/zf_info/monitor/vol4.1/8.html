<H2>POSTER VIEWING AS A CONTACT SPORT</H2>

	The recent zebrafish development meeting at Cold Spring Harbor was, from my point of view, very successful, an intellectual feast served up against the background of spring on Long Island.  To northerners still experiencing the final assault of winter at home, the sight of tree blossoms and flowers, the sound of birds and frogs, and the feel of the warm spring sunshine, is seductive.  It is hard to imagine that in this idyllic setting danger lurks, but it does.  You may be thinking of the devastating allergic reactions brought on by those innocent blossoms, and all the itchy eyes and palates and noses you saw or heard or experienced, but the most dangerous thing at Cold Spring Harbor actually is poster-viewing.<P>
	Once in the crowded aisles of the Bush Lecture Hall between the posters, you are in immediate danger of being stepped on, tripped up, elbowed, jostled, speared, or overcome by heat or claustrophobia.  It is particularly difficult in this group dominated by tall Americans and northern Europeans, if you happen to be short and are caught in a group of people single-mindedly pursuing disparate routes to target posters in different parts of the room.  It is that awful feeling of being trapped in the hypoblast while the epiblast walks all over you.<P>
	Successful poster viewing, is best treated as a contact sport.  The following tips will help you reach your poster destinations, get you within range of the presenter, and provide you with a view of the written material.<P>
<OL>
<LI>Do not wear open-toed sandals.  There may be many viewers out there who are taller and heavier and wearing sturdier footwear (fortunately stiletto heels are not in vogue for poster-viewing).  Remember when you are trodden that the offenders are probably not malicious, they just have a poor view of the floor through the thicket of legs.<P>
<LI>Drink plenty of liquids before the poster session (this is particularly important if you have been training in the bar the previous night; see item 6).  It will be hot and sweaty and it may be some time before you are able to navigate out to the drinking fountain.  Also, a well-lubricated throat has a better chance of projecting sound above the general din.<P>
<LI>Do some stretching and flexibility exercises before attempting to view the posters.  You will be in much better shape to twist and squat and take advantage of gaps at any level in front of your chosen poster.<P>
<LI>As with other spectator sports, it may be useful to bring a pair of small binoculars in case you are unable to work your way in to close range. Note that meeting decorum calls for confining binocular use to the posters.<P>
<LI>If you're not nimble enough to avoid being knocked off your feet, bring along a couple of sure-footed friends to block for you.<P>
<LI>The best form of cross-training may be a few sessions in the bar when the evening talks have ended.  There you will have plenty of practice squeezing into small open spaces, moving against the body tide, and attracting the attention of the distant bartender.  If you have perfected the "elbows out" technique and have survived without spilling a drink, you are ready for the poster hall.<P>
<LI>And finally, if you wish to resort to trickery to clear a space for yourself, just ask loudly if it is expressed in the nose.<P>
