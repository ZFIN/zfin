	When amputated, the fins of adult zebrafish rapidly regenerate the missing tissue. Fin regeneration proceeds through several stages, including wound healing, establishment of the wound epithelium, recruitment of the blastema  from mesenchymal cells underlying the wound epithelium, and differentiation and outgrowth of the regenerate.  We screened for temperature-sensitive mutations that affect the regeneration of the fin.  Seven mutations were identified, including five that fail to regenerate their fins, one that causes slow growth during regeneration, and one that causes dysmorphic bumps or tumors to develop in the regenerating fin.  <I>reg5</I> mutants fail to regenerate their caudal fins, whereas <I>reg6</I> mutants develop dysmorphic bumps in their regenerates at the restrictive temperature. Temperature shift experiments indicate that <I>reg5</I> and <I>reg6 </I> affect different stages of regeneration.  The critical period for <I>reg5 </I>occurs during the early stages of regeneration before or during establishment of the blastema, resulting in defects in subsequent growth of the blastema and failure to differentiate bone forming cells.  The critical period for <I>reg6</I>  occurs after the onset of bone differentiation and during early stages of regenerative outgrowth.  Both <I>reg5</I> and <I>reg6</I> also show temperature-sensitive defects in embryonic development or in ontogenetic outgrowth of the juvenile fin.
