<H3>Introduction</H3><P>

	We have previously reported the binding of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of SV40 T antigen to plasmid DNA, and the induction of transgene expression following injection of DNA-NLS complexes into the yolk of fertilized zebrafish eggs (Collas et al., 1996). NLS peptides were bound to DNA by simple ionic interaction at a 100:1 molar ratio of NLS:DNA. NLS peptides bound to plasmid DNA efficiently target DNA-NLS complexes to nuclei. Transient reporter gene expression with 104 plasmid copies injected per egg using this system is similar to that with 106-107 copies injected without the NLS peptide (see, e.g., Stuart et al., 1988; Culp et al. 1991; Collas et al. 1996). Binding NLS peptides to 106 plasmid copies or more is detrimental to transgene expression and zebrafish embryo survival (Collas et al., 1996).<P>
	We present here the procedure used in our laboratory to prepare plasmid DNA-NLS complexes for cytoplasmic injection into zebrafish eggs. Complexes are prepared at a ratio of 100 moles of NLS per mole of DNA. It is assumed that 10,000 plasmid copies are injected per egg, in a volume of 250 pl. Note that plasmid DNA can be in supercoiled or linear form.  The recipe is  for the following NLS peptide: CGGPKKKRKVG-NH2 (Collas et al., 1996a).<P>

<H3>Procedure</H3>

<LI>1. Calculate the intended concentration of plasmid DNA in the injection solution, taking into account DNA copy number and volume to be injected per egg. Prepare a DNA solution at 100x this concentration in H<SUB>2</SUB>O.

<LI>2. Calculate the number of moles of NLS peptide required to obtain a final NLS:DNA molar ratio of 100:1. Calculate the corresponding number of grams of NLS (M = 974), and prepare a 5x NLS solution in H<SUB>2</SUB>O (from an initial frozen stock dissolved in ddH<SUB>2</SUB>O at 1 mg/ml). 

<LI>3. Prepare 1 ml of 1 M KCl in H<SUB>2</SUB>O, and 1 ml of 1% phenol red in H<SUB>2</SUB>O.

<LI>4. Prepare the injection solution by mixing together:<P>

and incubate for 30 min at room temp.<P>
			
<LI>5. Filter the solution and proceed with injections (Collas et al., 1996b). This solution can be stored for at least two weeks at 4<SUP>o</SUP>C.
