<H1>Zebrafish Science Monitor Vol 4(1)</H1>

<H3>June 10, 1996</H3>
<HR SIZE=2>
<H3>Editorial</H3>
<H2><B>A PLEA FOR CONVENTIONS</B></H2>

Several hallway conversations at the recent Cold Spring Harbor meeting brought gripes about misuse of nomenclature to the fore.<P>

Can you believe that some of us are still naming genes "zf-blah"?  Naughty, naughty.  That's not allowed.<P>

We suppose some of you figure conventions are just for old fuddy duddies; who cares about those old rules anyway?  But, hey, aren't we all supposed to be scholars?<P>

Next time you are faced with the fun task of naming a cloned gene or a new mutant, remember that there are a few simple rules to help you keep from making a fool of yourself.  We summarize them in this issue of the Monitor and encourage you to read and remember them.<P>
