<p>
Gene Ontology (GO) terms are derived from dynamic controlled vocabularies, or ontologies, produced by the <A HREF="http://www.geneontology.org/">Gene Ontology Consortium</A> to describe the roles of genes and gene products in all organisms.  The Gene Ontology Consortium has developed and continues to expand ontologies of terms that define the molecular functions, biological
processes, and cellular components:
<p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Molecular Function:</b> Terms that describe what a gene product does at a
  biochemical level. 
  </li>
  <li><b>Biological Process:</b> Broad biological processes that are accomplished by
  ordered assemblies of molecular functions. 
  </li>
  <li><b>Cellular Component:</b> Subcellular structures, locations, and macromolecular
  complexes in the cell where a gene product is found.
  </li>
</ul>

<font size=+1><b>GO Annotations in ZFIN</b></font> 
<p>
The GO annotations in ZFIN are divided into four columns:
<table colspan=2>
  <tr>
    <td align=left valign=top>
      <b>Ontology</b> 
    </td>
    <td align=left>
      From which ontology the GO term is derived (Molecular Function, Biological Process, or Cellular Component).
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align=left valign=top>
      <b>GO Term</b> 
    </td> 
    <td align=left>
      The Gene Ontology term.  The GO term is linked to the QuickGO ontology browser entry.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align=left valign=top>
      <b>Evidence</b> 
    </td>
    <td align=left>
      The <A HREF="http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml">evidence code</A> supporting the annotation of the GO term to the gene product.  The evidence code in the table is linked to a list of descriptions, criteria, and use of each evidence code.
    </td>
  <tr>
    <td align=left valign=top>
      <b>Reference</b>
    </td>
    <td>
       A link to the reference in ZFIN from which the annotation was derived.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
