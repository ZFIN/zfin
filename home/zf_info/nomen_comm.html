<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><font size="+1">Activities 
  of the Zebrafish Nomenclature Committee</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The zebrafish nomenclature committee, 
  appointed at the Cold Spring Harbor meeting a couple of years ago, is alive 
  and well. Our job is to provide guidelines and advice for naming zebrafish genes 
  and mutants. The guidelines are based on input from the zebrafish research community 
  and on the rules used for naming human and mouse genes. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">During the past several years, we 
  have participated in the International Nomenclature Workshops and have published 
  updated guidelines in Trends in Genetics (Genetic Nomenclature Guide, 1998). 
  The current guidelines are available on ZFIN (<a href="/zf_info/nomen.html">http://ZFIN.org/zf_info/nomen.html</a>). 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The committee continuously reviews 
  zebrafish gene names to consolidate multiple names for the same gene, to assign 
  uniform names to all members of gene families, and to clarify the relationships 
  between genes in zebrafish and other vertebrates. These reviews often require 
  BLAST, cluster and mapping analysis. We also work closely with the nomenclature 
  committees for mouse and human. The approved name and all other previous names 
  of all published zebrafish genes are listed on ZFIN. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We encourage all of you to consult 
  the committee before publishing new gene names. ZFIN currently supports a mechanism 
  for researchers to reserve names for newly discovered mutants. These names are 
  reviewed by the committee to ensure they conform to accepted nomenclature conventions 
  and then given a tentative approval that reserves the name until the mutant 
  or gene is published. This mechanism can easily be extended to provide an automatic 
  means for checking names of genes identified by molecular means. Are you interested 
  in such a service? </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The mouse and human research communities 
  now require approval from their respective nomenclature committees before new 
  names can be published. Most of the major journals support this process by requiring 
  a statement of the committee's approval for all new names before the manuscript 
  is published. This helps avoid changing names later because of nomenclature 
  problems. Is the zebrafish research community ready for this? </font></p>
