<h2 align="center">Activities of the Zebrafish Nomenclature Committee</h2>
<p>The rapidly expanding wealth of zebrafish genetic and genomic information makes 
  it essential to give unique and meaningful names to every zebrafish gene. Good 
  nomenclature practices foster unambiguous communication within the research 
  community and make electronic data retrieval much easier and more efficient.</p>
<p>The Zebrafish Nomenclature Committee, appointed at a Cold Spring Harbor meeting 
   several years ago, is alive and well. Our job is to provide guidelines and 
  advice for naming genes and mutants. These conventions are based on input from 
  the zebrafish community and on the rules used for naming human and mouse genes.</p>
<p>During the past several years, we have participated in the International Nomenclature 
  Workshops and have published updated guidelines in Trends in Genetics (Genetic 
  Nomenclature Guide, 1998). The current guidelines are available on ZFIN (<a href="/zf_info/nomen.html">http://zfin.org/zf_info/nomen.html</a>). 
</p>
<p>The committee continuously reviews zebrafish gene names to consolidate multiple 
  names for the same gene, to assign uniform names to all members of gene families, 
  and to clarify the relationships between genes in zebrafish and other vertebrates. 
  These reviews often require BLAST, cluster and mapping analysis. We also work 
  closely with the mouse and human nomenclature committees. The approved name 
  and all other previous names of all published zebrafish genes are listed on 
  ZFIN.</p>
<p>We encourage all of you to consult the committee before publishing new gene 
  names. ZFIN currently supports a mechanism for researchers to reserve names 
  for newly discovered mutants. These names are reviewed by the committee to ensure 
  they conform to accepted nomenclature conventions and then given a tentative 
  approval that reserves the name until the mutant or gene is published. To reserve 
  names for genes identified by molecular means, you can contact the ZFIN nomenclature 
  coordinator (<a href="mailto:nomenclature@ZFIN.org">nomenclature@zfin.org</a>).</p>
<p>The mouse and human research communities now require approval from their respective 
  nomenclature committees before new names can be published. Most of the major 
  journals support this process by requiring a statement of the committee's approval 
  for all new names before the manuscript is published. This helps avoid changing 
  names later because of nomenclature problems. Is the zebrafish research community 
  ready for this?</p>
<p>Please give us your feedback at: <a href="mailto:nomenclature@ZFIN.org">nomenclature@zfin.org</a></p>
