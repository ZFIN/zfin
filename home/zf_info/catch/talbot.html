<p> <h1><strong>A Zebrafish Map for Comparative and 
Functional Genomics</strong></h1>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Talbot and Postlethwait groups are collaborating to localize zebrafish genes on an integrated 
genetic linkage map. Our goal is to construct a map with 3000 genes in a framework of 500 
SSLPs from the Fishman group.  This map will accelerate the discovery of gene functions by 
increasing the number of mapped candidate genes for mutations. Furthermore, genes are uniquely 
suited markers for comparative genomics, and we plan to assemble a map of chromosomal 
segments conserved between zebrafish and human. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Previous gene maps were constructed with haploid mapping panels, which simplify linkage 
analysis but allow only 1000-2000 markers to be scored in each individual (because of the 
limited genomic DNA available in haploid embryos). To overcome this limitation while retaining 
the benefits of haploid panels, we are employing a homozygous diploid mapping panel produced 
by heat shock treatment of the embryonic offspring from two C32/SJD F1females. Genomic 
DNA for 10,000-100,000 markers is available from each of the 47 individuals that comprise the 
panel. By scoring SSCPs linked to genes and ESTs, we plan to create a dense, gene-based map 
with a resolution of 2 cM (about 1.2 Mb average physical distance). This resolution will allow 
investigators to identify genes near mutations of interest; any candidate genes in the interval can 
then be tested in mutant mapping crosses of higher resolution. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h2><strong>Progress </strong></h2>
As of June 2, 1999, we have assigned preliminary map positions to 474 markers scored in the 
heat shock diploid panel (Kelly, Chu, Ngo-Hazelett, Kimm,Gates, Yan, Postlethwait, and Talbot, 
unpublished). Approximately 350 of these markers are SSLPs previously mapped by the Fishman 
group. These markers will form a framework that will allow the heat shock panel map to be 
integrated with previous maps and mutant mapping crosses. Most of the remaining 
polymorphisms are SSCPs linked to genes and ESTs. We are planning to score ~150 more 
SSLPs to complete the framework, after which our efforts will focus on mapping genes for the 
duration of the project. To facilitate the integration of meiotic and radiation hybrid maps, we 
have provided primers for more than 600 genes and ESTs to the Tuebingen RH group. Many of 
these loci have been incorporated into the RH map (Robert Geisler, personal communication); 
these and other shared markers will allow a straightforward comparison of the genetic and 
physical maps.

<p>To allow rapid public access to the heat shock panel map, we plan to release data in two forms.<strong> </strong> 

<p><strong>(1)</strong> Starting in July, and continuing every 4-6 months thereafter, we will release refined maps 
supported by data that have been extensively checked for discrepancies.  

<p><strong>(2)</strong> Between releases of refined maps, genotype data will be available as downloadable 
MapManager files (see http://cmgm.stanford.edu/~tallab/Frontpage.html). These files will 
contain preliminary map assignments and the genotype data that support them. These interim 
releases will not be extensively checked for errors! It will be the responsibility of users to 
evaluate the map data and decide for themselves whether a map assignment is reliable for their 
purposes.  The current release (June 2, 1999) contains preliminary assignments for 474 markers. 
In addition, we have posted published map data and 36 unpublished gene and EST assignments 
from our haploid mapping panel (Gates, Schier, and Talbot, unpublished).
