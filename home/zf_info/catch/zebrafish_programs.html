  <li><b><a href="http://www.nih.gov/science/models/zebrafish/">Trans-NIH Zebrafish Initiative</a>:</b><br>
The NIH established the Trans-NIH Zebrafish Coordinating Committee in the fall of 1997 in response to the scientific community's recommendation to promote the use of zebrafish as a model organism for the study of vertebrate development and disease.  This website was created to provide a central information resource, focusing on major NIH-organized zebrafish meetings; funding opportunities for zebrafish genomics and genetic resources; major resources generated from grants funded in response to Trans-NIH zebrafish initiatives; major zebrafish genomic and genetic resources; courses and scientific meetings related to the zebrafish initiatives; and, selected reports and publications.

    <li><b><a href="http://www.zf-health.org/">EU ZF-HEALTH Consortium</a>:</b><br> Zebrafish Models for Human Development and Disease is an Integrated Project funded by the European Commission.  The research efforts cover five areas:
      <ul>
        <li>Mutagenesis screening</li>
	<li>Analysis of expression patterns</li>
	<li>Expression profiling and proteomics</li>
	<li>Targeted knock-out</li>
	<li>Bioinformatics</li>
      </ul>

  <br>The European network on Fish Biomedical Models (EUFishBioMed) is a network devoted to fostering exchange of information, techniques, materials and expertise within and beyond the fish community. We are dedicated to promoting the further development of the technologies and versatilities of fish models in biomedical research and to make these accessible to other users, such as the medical, pharmaceutical and industrial communities.

<p>Currently more than 120 Europe-based research groups are linked by this network. An overview, information on the specific expertise, and the contact details of each laboratory's PI (principal investigator) is offered via the coordinating institution (FZK) upon request.
