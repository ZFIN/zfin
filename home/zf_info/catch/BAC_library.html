<p><font face="Arial Black" size="4">*****FIRST RECEIPT DATE - NOVEMBER 15,
2001*****</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Instructions for proposing organisms from which to make
new BAC libraries (October 9, 2001)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Over the past several years, the bacterial artificial
chromosome (BAC) has emerged as the vector system of choice for the construction
of the large-insert chromosomal DNA libraries that are needed in genomic
studies. Because BAC clones are relatively large and appear to faithfully
represent an organism's genome, the BAC system will also be the vehicle of
choice for the isolation of targeted regions of genomic DNA from additional
organisms being used in specific biological studies, a variety of mouse strains,
and even from individual humans. With the increasing interest in genomic
approaches to biological research, the demand for new BAC libraries is expected
to increase rapidly in the next several years. To meet the need to increase the
number of available BAC libraries, NHGRI, NCRR, NIMH and NICHD plan to award a
set of cooperative agreements (by December 1, 2001) to form the NIH BAC Resource
Network and increase the national BAC library- making capacity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">As of November 15, 2001, the following procedure will
apply to all requests from investigators who wish to the NIH-supported capacity
for constructing BAC libraries from the genome of any organism for which there
is currently no BAC library or for which a new library is needed. This procedure
applies to:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">* Requests for BAC library construction through the BAC
Library Resource Network. This procedure applies only to the choice of BAC
library construction targets for the cooperative agreements funded under the NIH
BAC Resource Network. Other agencies also support laboratories to construct BAC
libraries and inquiries about having BAC libraries made under that support
should be directed to those agencies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">* Requests for making BAC libraries from all organisms
except eubacteria, archaea, and plants. The Institutes supporting the BAC
Resource Network are components of the National Institutes of Health.
Accordingly, their primary missions are to develop and apply techniques of
genomics and large-scale biology to the improvement of human health and to the
improved understanding of science that will lead to the improvement of human
health. The sequencing of eubacterial, archaeal, and plant genomes are more
appropriate to the missions of other components of the NIH and/or other
agencies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The following is a set of instructions that describe how
individuals, groups, or entire research communities can submit requests to gain
access to this resource and how decisions about allocating the capacity will be
made.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">1. To propose an organism as a candidate for having a BAC
library constructed from its genome, a written request must be submitted to
NHGRI.</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">a. The written request should address the following
  issues:</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">The importance of the organism to biomedical or
      biological research;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Uses to which the BAC library would be put, in
      addition to genomic sequencing;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">The size of the research community that could
      potentially use the BAC library and the community's interest in and
      support for having a BAC library;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Whether the organism will be, or has been, proposed
      to NHGRI or another publicly funded agency for BAC-based genomic
      sequencing and the status of that request;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Other genomic resources that are available that will
      complement this resource;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">The strain of the organism proposed and rationale for
      its selection</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">The size of the genome;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">The availability of a source of DNA for construction
      of the BAC library (evidence of its quality for this purpose);</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Specifications for the library (e.g., library depth,
      BAC insert size) and supporting scientific rationale for these
      specifications.</font>&nbsp; <font face="Arial">(Note: any request for an
      unusual vector for a particular application must be thoroughly discussed);</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">The time frame in which the library is needed;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Other support that is available or has been requested
      for the construction of the desired library;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">The need for an additional BAC library if one or more
      already exists; and</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Any other relevant information.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Arial">b. Other NIH Institutes or Centers may subsequently
  decide to contribute funds to this program for the construction of a specific
  BAC library using the expanded national BAC library-making capacity. In such
  cases, the decision about the need for preparing the library will already have
  been made. A written request must be still submitted, but can be limited to a
  discussion of the specifications needed and DNA resources available, so that
  the library maker will have the information necessary to develop a plan for
  making the library.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">c. A written request may be submitted by an individual,
  a research group or a collaborative group, or by an individual(s) on behalf of
  an entire research community.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">d. The written request should not exceed a total of five
  pages and must address all of the issues under 1a. If one or more issues are
  not applicable to the specific request, that should be stated clearly, rather
  than not addressed. There is no specific form necessary for submission of a
  request nor is any specific format required, but all of the issues listed in
  item 1a should be addressed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">e. The first set of written requests will be accepted on
  November 15, 2001. Thereafter, written requests will be accepted three times a
  year, on February 1, June 1, and October 1.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">f. The written request should be submitted by e-mail to:
  <u><font COLOR="#008000"><a href="mailto:BAC_Library_Requests@mail.nih.gov">BAC_Library_Requests@mail.nih.gov</a></font></u></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial">2. A peer review committee set up by NHGRI program staff
will assess the written requests on the basis of scientific interest and
strategic feasibility based on the responsiveness to the issues described under
1a, and will establish a priority ranking for each request. The membership will
be posted at www.nhgri.nih.gov once the committee is formed. The assessment
process will NOT involve the regular NIH peer review system.</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">a. For each organism proposed, the committee will
  recommend whether the NIH BAC Resource Network should accept the request and,
  if so, whether it should be assigned to a high priority pool or to a standard
  priority pool. If the written request does not present enough information or a
  strong enough case to the allow the committee to come to a decision, the
  request will be declined and the applicant can resubmit the request at the
  next deadline.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">b. Libraries whose construction is specifically being
  funded by other NIH Institutes participating in this program will
  automatically be assigned to the high priority pool, unless there is a serious
  flaw in the proposed plan.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">c. The committee's decisions will be reported yearly, in
  writing, by NHGRI staff to the National Advisory Council for Human Genome
  Research.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial">3. New libraries to be constructed will be chosen from the
priority pools on a schedule to be agreed upon by NHGRI staff and the
laboratories participating in the BAC Library Resource Network.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">4. The BAC library Resource Network will be overseen by a
BAC Resource Steering Panel of 4-6 scientists, who will regularly evaluate the
program's overall progress and make recommendations to the NHGRI and
participating Institutes about any adjustments that need to be made to the
program. This membership of this Panel will be posted at www.nhgri.nih.gov once
the committee is selected.</font></p>
