<h1>RFA on Mutagenesis Screen/Phenotyping Tools for Zebrafish</h1>
<p>The Trans-NIH Zebrafish Coordinating Committee (ZFCC), under the co-chairmanship 
  of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and 
  the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) 
  is soliciting proposals designed to exploit the power of mutagenesis screening 
  in zebrafish in order to detect and characterize genes, pathways, and phenotypes 
  of interest in development, behavior, organ formation, and disease processes. 
  The objective is to broaden the range, power, and utility of screens for new 
  mutants of zebrafish. Proposals both for the development of improved or novel 
  methods for mutagenesis screens, as well as for the actual execution of such 
  screens are appropriate. Applications that propose to advance the technologies 
  associated with such phenotyping also are welcome. Methodology developed and 
  data and mutants generated as a result of this RFA are expected to be made widely 
  available to the research community. </p>
<p>Although this RFA is the result of a trans-NIH initiative, awards will be made 
  through the Institute/Center (IC) whose mission is most closely related to the 
  proposed work. Potential applicants are encouraged to contact one of the program 
  representatives cited under "Inquiries" in the RFA. The findings of research 
  supported by this RFA will be shared with all participating ICs through the 
  ZFCC. As part of the requirements of this RFA, grantees will also participate 
  in meetings with the NIH staff to share scientific progress. </p>
<p>This RFA will use the R01 grant mechanism. Applicants may request a budget 
  for direct costs of up to $250,000 per year, excluding Facilities & Administrative 
  costs on consortium arrangements, for up to 5 years of support. ZFCC anticipates 
  making approximately 8-10 awards. Letters of intent are due on April 16, 2000, 
  and applications are due on May 19, 2000. The full text of this RFA can be found
