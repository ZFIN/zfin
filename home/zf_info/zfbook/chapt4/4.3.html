<H1>CHAPTER 4 - MICROSCOPIC OBSERVATIONS</H1>
<H2>AGAR MOUNTING</H2>
(Source: J. Eisen)<p>

  For more precise orientation of zebrafish embryos and to keep them from floating around during long term observations, embed them in agar.

<H3>Mounting</H3>

<P>
1.  Prepare a 1.2% solution of agar in embryo medium (or Ringers solution if the embryos are to be injected or prepared for some other invasive procedure; see <a href="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt10.html">RECIPES</a>, Chapter 10) by heating in a boiling water bath or in a microwave oven.  This solution remains liquid at 37-40&#176;C, but quickly hardens when cooled.
<P>
2.  Keep a small amount of solution (5 ml) liquid in a test tube in a 42&#176;C water bath.
<P>
3.  Keep an extra glass plate from the stage of the stereomicroscope warm by immersing it in the water bath.
<P>
4.  Just before mounting the embryos, replace the room temperature glass plate with the warm one; be sure to dry it completely before using it.  
<P>
5.  Take the test tube containing the agar out of the water bath and transfer an embryo in a minimum amount of Ringers solution into it.
<P>
6.  Place a viewing chamber (1) on the warm glass plate on the stereomicroscope.  Quickly suck up the embryo in a small drop of agar and transfer it onto the chamber, keeping it clear of the cover slips that have been glued on.
<P>
7.  Using a fine minutien pin (0.10 mm diameter) mounted on a needle holder or on an applicator stick, position the embryo at the appropriate angle in the agar and allow the agar to harden.
<P>
8.  After the agar hardens, use a razor blade to cut out a small block of agar containing the embryo.  Slide the block, in the appropriate orientation, until it is pushed against the glued-on cover slips.  Remove residual liquid surrounding the agar block with a Kimwipe.  Place a small drop of liquid agar over the agar block to hold it in place.  When this hardens, cover the preparation with Ringers solution, as with embryo medium.
<P>

<H3>Removing embryos from agar</H3>
<P>

1.  To remove an embryo from the agar, place several drops of medium on top of the agar.
<P>
2.  Using a pointed scalpel or a minutien pin attached to a needle holder or applicator stick, create a "V" shaped cut in the agar with the point of the "V" aiming towards the embryo's head.<P>

3.  Hold the tips of a pair of sharp forceps closed and plunge them into the agar between the point of the "V" cut and the head of the embryo.<P>

4.  Gently open the points of the forceps creating a crack in the agar which will run along the length of the embryo.<P>

5.  The embryo will then float out of the agar into the saline and can be picked up with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette.
