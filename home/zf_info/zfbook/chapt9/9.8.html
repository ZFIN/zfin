<br>
          1.                   Fix embryos with 4% paraformaldehyde in
                                           PBS overnight at 4&#176;C.<br>
<br>
          2.                   Wash twice in PBS, 5 min each, at
                                           RT.<br>
<br>
          3.                   Remove the embryos from their chorions
                                           using watchmaker forceps (easiest at this
                                           point).<br>
<br>
          4.                   Transfer embryos to vials with 100%
                                           methanol (MeOH), replace with fresh
                                           methanol after 5 min.  Use MeOH and not
                                           ethanol, since ethanol causes a higher
                                           background!<br>
<br>
<B>Note:</B>                    From this point on, the embryos remain in the same glass
                                vial until they are ready for prehybridization.<br>
<br>
          5.                   Cool
                                           the embryos to -20&#176;C for
                                           at least 30 min
                                           (embryos can be
                                           stored that way for
                                           months; this step is
                                           necessary for
                                           permeabilization of
                                           embryos even if you
                                           don't want to store
                                           them).<BR>
<br>
          6.                   Bring the embryos back to
                                           RT.<br>
<br>
          7.                   Imme
                                           rse 5 min in 50%
                                           MeOH in PBST and
                                           then 5 min in 30%
                                           MeOH in
                                           PBST.<BR>
<br>
          8.                   Rinse twice in PBST for 5 min
                                           each.<br>
<br>
<B>Note:</B>                    Embryos can also be removed from their chorions at this
                                point, but chorions are sticky after having been in
                                MeOH<br>
<br>
          9.                   Fix for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in
                                           PBS at RT.<br>
<br>
          10.                  Rinse
                                           twice in PBST for 5
                                           min
                                           each.
                                           
<br>
<br><B><I>Proteinase digestion and postfixation</B></I><br>
<br>
          1.                   Digest with proteinase K (10 &#181;g/ml in
                                           PBST) at RT for 5 to 12 min (depends on
                                           the stage; younger stages are more sensitive;
                                           depends, also, on the batch of enzyme; we
                                           test each new batch).<br>
<br>
          2.                   Rinse briefly in PBST; wash for 5 min in
                                           PBST.<br>
<br>
          3.                   Fix as above (4% paraformaldehyde in PBS,
                                           20 min).<br>
<br>
          4.                   Wash
                                           as above (2 times in
                                           PBST).</blockquote>
<br>
<B><I>Acetic anhydride treatment (optional)</I></B><br>
<br>
          1.                   Replace PBST with dH<em sub>2</em>O (as
                                           quantitatively as
                                           possible).<br>
<br>
          2.                   As quickly as possible, replace H<em
                                           sub>2</em>O with a fresh mixture of 2.5
                                           &#181;l acetic anhydride in 1 ml of 0.1M
                                           triethanolamine (pH
                                           7.0).<br>
<br>
          3.                   Incubate for 10-60 min at
                                           RT.<BR>
<br>
          4.                   Wash 2 times for 10 min each in
                                           PBST.<br>
<br>
          This treatment helps reduce background from endogenous phosphatases
 and is therefore only necessary in cases where background is a problem.  It is
also unnecessary if peroxidase-coupled anti-digoxigenin antibodies are used.<br>
<br>
<B><I>Prehybridization</I></B><br>
<br>
          1.                   Transfer embryos (up to 40) into small
                                           eppendorf tubes (0.8ml) in approximately
                                           300 &#181;l of HYB*.<br>
<br>
          2.                   Incubate 5 min at 55&#176;C;
                                           afterwards, replace HYB*
                                           with an equal volume of HYB+.<br>
<br>
          3.                   Prehybridize at 55&#176;C for
                                           1-48 hr in HYB+.<br>
<br>
<B><I>Probes</I></B><br>
<br>
          Prepare RNA Probes according to the Boehringer instructions (Cat.
#1175025).  About 5 to 10 &#181;g of digoxigenin-labeled probe is transcribed
from 1 &#181;g of a linearized plasmid.  Hydrolyze the probes to an average
length of 150-300 nucleotides following the protocol of Cox <I>et al</I>.
(1984; <I>Devel. Biol.</I> <B>101</B>:485-502).  After the final
precipitation, the hydrolyzed probe should be taken up directly in HYB+ and
stored at 20&#176;C.<br>
<br>
<B><I>Hybridization</I></B><br>
<br>
          1.                   Remove as much of the preHYB+ as possible without letting the embryos touch air.<br>
<br>
          2.                   Add 20 to 40 &#181;l of fresh HYB+ containing 20-100 ng of RNA
                                           probe (about 0.5-5.0 ng/&#181;l) so that all
                                           embryos are covered by the solution.  Heat
                                           the probe in HYB+ for 5
                                           min at 68&#176;C before
                                           adding to the embryos.  For some probes,
                                           signal intensity decreases below 10 ng;
                                           amounts higher than 100 ng don't usually
                                           give a higher signal intensity.  Probably the
                                           amount of probe to add depends upon the
                                           amount of RNA you want to detect and has
                                           to be titrated.<br>
<br>
          3.                   Incubate overnight at 55&#176;C.<br>
<br>
<B><I>Probe removal</I></B><br>
<br>
          Remove probe (probes can be reused twice; using them more often results
in weaker signals.  The probes in HYB+ are stable for at least
half a year).<br>
<br>
          <B>Option A:</B><br>
<br>
          1.                   Soak
                                           embryos for 20 min at
                                           55&#176;C in

<br>
<B>IMPORTANT:</B>  For some probes, the RNAse treatment is
unnecessary and decreases the signal intensity.  For other probes, omitting the
RNAse leads to an unacceptably high background.  It is therefore advisable to test
whether the RNAse treatment is necessary for any given probe.  If you can do
without it, follow Option B; if not, use Option A.<br>

          8.                   Dehydrate with 100% MeOH twice (10 min
                                           each) and mount in a 2:1 mixture of
                                           benzylbenzoate:benzylalcohol.  This mixture
                                           has the same refractive index as yolk and
                                           clears the embryos very
                                           well.<br>
<br>
          If one uses alkaline phosphatase as a detection enzyme one has to be aware
that NBT/X-Phosphate will fade in anhydrous solutions.  Fixing the embryos after
the color reaction is necessary if you want to clear the embryos in alcohol.  After
 fixation (4% paraformaldehyde at RT for at least half an hour) even weaker
signals are reasonably stable in alcohol.  You can also overstain with careful
monitoring of the dehydration and clearing process.  Another alternative is to
photograph weak signals immediately after transferring the specimen to alcohol
or to clear them in glycerol.<br>
