<H1>CHAPTER 9 - MOLECULAR METHODS</H1>
<H2>Preparation of High Quality RNA from Zebrafish Embryos</H2>
(Source: S. Schulte-Merker and C. N&uuml;sslein-Volhard)<br>
<br>
          This procedure, which is adapted from Brown and Kafatos (<I>J. Mol.
Biol</I>. <B>203</B>:425-437), produces high yields and is fast (from
embryo to EtOH in less than 2.5 hours).  Also, it works well for all stages and
tissues and yields high quality RNA.  One drawback is the danger of working
with hot phenol; use extreme care to assure that the nitrogen has boiled off
completely.<BR>
<br>
          1.                   Cool a mortar on dry ice; use liquid
                                           nitrogen to cool other equip-
                                           ment.<br>
<br>
          2.                   Pour embryos (100 or more) into a small
                                           sieve and "dry" them by holding a paper
                                           towel against the sieve (or towel dry adult). 
                                           Transfer the embryos (or adult) to the
                                           mortar containing liquid
                                           nitrogen.<br>
<br>
          3.                   Homogenize the embryos (or the adult)
                                           carefully with a precooled pestle while there
                                           is still nitrogen present. This is best done by
                                           pounding, not grinding, with the pestle. 
                                           When the liquid nitrogen is gone, grind
                                           everything up to a fine
                                           powder.<br>
<br>
          4.                   Transfer the powder to a Falcon tube (50ml)
                                           containing liquid nitrogen.  Use a precooled
                                           spatula to transfer the powder as
                                           quantitatively as
                                           possible.<br>
<br>
          5.                   The powder can be stored at -70&#176;C for a couple of days. 
                                           Make sure that the powder never thaws
                                           before proceeding to step
                                           5.<br>
<br>
          6.                   Heat a 1:1 mixture of unbuffered phenol
                                           (pH 4-5) and 2xNETS (200 mM NaCl, 2
                                           mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1% SDS)
                                           to 95&#176;C (at this
                                           temperature, the mixture forms only a single
                                           phase).  <I><B>Beware:
                                           wear goggles, gloves,
                                           etc.</I></B><br>
<br>
          7.                   Take the Falcon tubes from step 4/5 and let
                                           the liquid nitrogen boil away <em
                                           u><B>completely</B></em>.</bl
                                           ockquote><br>
<br>
          8.                   Make sure the opening of the tube points
                                           away from you.  Immediately add about 10
                                           ml of the 95&#176;C hot
                                           phenol/NETS mixture to the
                                           powder.<br>
<br>
          9.                   Close the tube and vortex immediately for 1
                                           minute.  The RNA is safe now, and you can
                                           do as many samples as you
                                           wish.<br>
<br>
          10.                  After the samples have cooled, centrifuge
                                           for 20 minutes at 5,000
                                           rpm.<br>
<br>
          11.                  Remove the supernatant and re-extract the
                                           organic phase with 1 vol of 2xNETS. 
                                           <br>
<br>
          12.                  Combine the two aqueous phases and extract
                                           them once more with unbuffered
                                           phenol.<br>
<br>
          13.                  Centrifuge and extract the aqueous phase
                                           twice with phenol:chloroform and once with
                                           chloroform.  <br>
<br>
          14.                  Precipitate the RNA by adding 0.1 vol 3 M
 NaAC and 2.5 vol EtOH.  Highest yields are obtained by leaving the samples
for a couple of days at -20&#176;C.<br>
<br>
          15.                  After centrifugation, wash the RNA with
                                           70% EtOH and dissolve in DEPC-treated
                                           water.  Typical yields are around 1 &#181;g
                                           RNA per embryo.<br>
<br>
          This method can be scaled down if RNA from only a few embryos is
required.  In this case, collect embryos in an Eppendorf tube.  Remove as much
water as possible and put the tubes into liquid nitrogen.  With a precooled device,
grind the embryos to a fine powder.  Afterwards, follow steps 4-15 and scale
down the required volumes accordingly.
