<p>

<p>
5. Add 4 ul DNAse and incubate 30 min at 37C
<p>
6. Add 40 ul H20DEPC
<p>
7. Prepare push column device: 
	<ul>
	<li>Push 70 ul TNE through column.   
	<li>Push probe through column.   
	<li>Push 70 ul TNE through column.   
	<li>Volume of purified probe will be about 110 ul.
	</ul>
<p>
8. Precipitate with 0.5 vol 7.8 M NH4Ac and 3 vol 100% EtOH at -20C for 30 min
<p>
9. Wash with 80% EtOH
<p>
10. Redissolve in 25 ul H20DEPC
<p>
11. Remove 1 ul and analyze on a 1% agarose gel. To check for incorporation you can blot and stain the gel or just do a dot blot.
<p>
12. Add 76 ul HB4-H20 and store at -20C
<p>
13. First try 1 ul probe in 100 ul HB4 for <i>in situ</i> hybridization
<p>
<b>Comments</b>
<p>
If you get high background with this probe concentration after a short
staining time, dilute your probe.  If you get no staining at all, this usually
means the probe is not very good.  Make a new one.
<p>
T7 RNA-Polymerase from Promega usually works and will produce about 10 ug of RNA. In my hands T3 RNA-Polymerase from Promega for some strange reason often gives a very low amount of RNA. But with good templates like krx-20 you still get a very good probe. For difficult templates try T3 RNA-Polymerase
from Boehringer which appears to produce more RNA. All in all it is better to
use T7 RNA-Polymerase to produce antisense RNA.
<p>
Wizard Miniprep DNA can be used to make the templates.  Dissolve in H2ODEPC.  It is best to use 1 ug of template.  More than 2 ug does not increase the amount of RNA significantly and less than 0.5 ug is not very effective.
<p>
You can also precipitate with NaAc instead of NH4Ac.  If you omit the push
column and just precipitate with NH4Ac, to save time you will also get a good
separation of nucleotides. However, precipitation with LiCl only is not very
effective in removing free nucleotides. Hydrolysis of the probe is not
advisable because this reduces the sensitivity of the probes.  Probes from 0.5-2.5 kb can be used without hydrolysis. Probes longer than 1 kb work best. If you
want to combine different fragments of the same gene to get a stronger probe,
mix them before the push column step.
<p>
<b><i>II.  Fixation and Storage of Zebrafish Embryos</b></i>
<p>
1. Transfer embryos of the desired stage to a small petri dish.

<p>
3. Heat the probe in 100 ul Hb4 at 80C for 5-10 min, quickly cool on ice/ethanol, spin down and keep on ice/ethanol. Replace prehybridization solution with probe solution. Incubate overnight.
<p>
<b><i>V.  Washes</i></b>

<p>
<b><i>VI.  Detection</i></b>
<p>
All detection steps are performed at RT and on a shaker except the staining reactions.
<p>
1. Block for 1-8 h with PBSTw plus 5% sheep serum.
<p>

Fab fragments at a 1:2000 dilution in PBSTw. You can reuse antibody 2x.

tube designated 1x used or 2x used.
<p>
4. Wash 6 x 20 min with PBSTw (you can perform one of the washes overnight).
<p>
5. Wash 2 x 5 min in 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.2, 0.1% Tween.
<p>
6. Dissolve Fast Red tablets in 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.2, 0.1% Tween (2 ml/tablet) and sterile filter.

<p>
17. Embryos may be fixed for at least 30 min and stored at 4C in PBSTw
(add NaNO3).
<p>
18. Mount in glycerol.
<p>
Do not clear embryos in alcohol because Fast Red precipitate is purported to be
unstable in ethanol.
<p>
<b>Comments</b>
<p>
To detect two different RNA transcripts in whole embryos make one RNA probe using Fluorescein-UTP and the other using Digoxigenin-UTP. Both probes are hybridized at the same time and detected one after another in two rounds of detection.  The crucial step is the inactivation and removal of the first applied Fab-AP conjugate using the low pH step after the first staining round. Inactivation of the first applied Fab-AP conjugate by heating is not recommended, since incubation at 65C for 20 min or at 80C for 10 min causes fading of the red precipitate resulting in a weaker and more diffuse signal. In contrast, the blue precipitate darkens resulting in an increased background in the embryo and a nearly black yolk. 
<p>
Because Fast Red is less sensitive than BCIP/NBT (5-10x) the stronger probe is always visualized in red. Because the second round of detection is less sensitive than the first, stain the red first. Nevertheless, if necessary, it is also possible to do the purple staining first. Fluorescein labeled probes are slightly less sensitive than digoxigenin probes. Therefore the stronger probe is usually detected in red using a fluorescein probe. To detect transcripts of a single gene use just one probe and one round of detection with BCIP/NBT as substrate.

<b>Antibodies, Stock Solutions and Reagents</b>
<p>
<i>Preadsorption of antibody with zebrafish embryos</i>
<p>
Zebrafish embryos need not to be dechorionated. The number of embryos you use for preabsorption depends on the amount of antibody you want to preabsorb. The stages used for preabsorption should include the same or older stages you will use in your <i>in situ</i> hybridizations. 2-3 d embryos work well.
<p>
1. Fix embryos in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4C overnight.
<p>
2. Wash 4 x 5 min in PBSTw.
<p>
3. Store embryos in 100% methanol at -20C.
<p>
4. Rehydrate 1 ml of embryos by rinsing 3 x 5 min in PBSTw.
<p>
5. Transfer embryos to a 2.0 ml Eppendorf tube.
<p>
6. Homogenize embryos with a pestle and adjust to about 1.0 ml with PBSTw.
<p>
7. Add 10 ul antibody (final 1:100).
<p>
8. Preabsorb antibody by shaking at least overnight or store for a few days at 4C.  Spin down embryonic debris and sterile filter (Millex-GV 0.22 um, Millipore) supernatant.
<p>
9. Resuspend embryonic debris in PBSTw and sterile filter again.
<p>
10. Fill up with PBSTw to a final 1:2000 dilution of antibody.
<p>
11. Store preabsorbed antibody (20 ml) at 4C.
<p>
12. The antibody preabsorbed with zebrafish embryos works well also for
staining of <i>Drosophila</i> embryos.
