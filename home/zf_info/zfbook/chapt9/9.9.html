          1.                   Use embryos in which alkaline phosphatase
                                           has been employed as a detection enzyme. 
                                           For the best results it is important to
                                           overstain heavily the whole-mount
                                           preparation.<br>
<br>
          2.                   Postfix embryos in 4% paraformaldehyde in
                                           PBS.  The tissue can be stored in this
                                           solution for an extended period of time in
                                           the dark at 4&#176;C.<br>
<br>
          3.                   Wash embryos in dH<em sub>2</em>O and
                                           dehydrate quickly through a graded series of
                                           methanol (50%, 70%, 95% and twice 100%
                                           2 to 3 min each).<br>
<br>
          4.                   Replace the methanol with propylene oxide,
                                           two changes for 5 min
                                           each.<br>
<br>
          5.                   Replace with a 1:1 mixture of Epon and
                                           propylene oxide for 30
                                           min.<br>
<br>
          6.                   Replace with a 3:1 mixture of
                                           Epon:propylene oxide for 2 to 3
                                           hours.<br>
<br>
          7.                   Transfer tissue to pure Epon for 4
                                           hours.<br>
<br>
          8.                   Embed in fresh Epon.  Polymerize overnight
                                           in a 60&#176;C
                                           oven.<br>
<br>
          9.                   Cut sections 5 to 10 &#181;m thick with a
                                           glass knife.  Dry down on a drop of water. 
                                           Cover slip in Permount.  Alternatively,
                                           cover slip in Epon and polymerize at 60&#176;C.<br>

          1.                   Wash stained embryos in PBS, two changes,
                                           2 to 3 min each.<br>
<br>
          2.                   Wash in dH<em
                                           sub>2</em>O.<br>
<br>
          3.                   Embed embryos in agar-sucrose as described
                                           in <B>Agar Mounting</B>, Chapter 4. 
                                           Cryoprotect in 30% sucrose and cut 14 to
                                           16 &#181;m sections in a -20&#176;C cryostat.  Pick up sections
                                           on subbed slides and dry at room
                                           temperature 2 to 3
                                           hours.<br>
<br>
          4.                   Wash sections in dH<em sub>2</em>O 2 to
                                           3 min and dehydrate through graded
                                           alcohols. Clear in xylene and mount in
                                           Permount.<br>

                                                                     0.2% methyl green or 1%
                                                                     neutral red can be used as
                                                                     a counterstain for the
                                                                     frozen sections.  Immerse
                                                                     slides briefly (30 to 90
                                                                     sec) in the staining
                                                                     solution, wash in dH<em
                                                                     sub>2</em>O, and
