PCR</B></I></H3><br>
<br>
          This protocol is most suitable for samples consisting of 1-20, diploid, 2-3
day old embryos.  Embryos need not be removed from their chorions.  DNA
prepared with this procedure is only good for PCR analysis, but is unsuitable for
digests and Southern blots.  Because PCR does not require high-molecular-weight
DNA, samples can be vortexed and frozen.<br>
<br>
          1.                   Transfer embryo(s) into microfuge tube and
                                           remove excess liquid with drawn-out Pasteur
                                           pipette.<br>
<br>
          2.                   Add extraction buffer, 50 &#181;l or 10 &#181;l per
                                           embryo whichever is larger, and incubate at
                                           50-56&#176;C for 2-3 hrs (longer is ok).  Vortex
                                           occasionally.  <br>
<br>
<br>
          <I><B>PCR Extraction buffer</B></I><br>
<br>
10 mM Tris pH 8<BR>
2 mM EDTA<BR>
0.2% Triton X-100<BR>
200 &#181;g/ml Proteinase K<br>
<br>
<br>
          3.                   Boil samples in waterbath for 5-10 min to
                                           inactivate Proteinase
                                           K.<br>
<br>
          4.                   Spin in microfuge for 1 min, store at -
                                           20&#176;C.<br>
<br>
          5.                   Use 10-15 &#181;l to set up PCR reaction in a
                                           total volume of 50 &#181;l, proceed with your
                                           favorite PCR
                                           protocol.<br>
<br>
<H3><I><B>Large sample number, still quick but less dirty</B></I></H3>
<br>
          This protocol produces cleaner preparations and probably somewhat higher
yields per embryo.  DNA prepared with this method from single haploid embryos
is satisfactory for multiple-primer (multiplex) PCR reactions.  The protocol is
provided for the preparation of DNA from single haploid embryos, but, of
course, can be adapted for more embryos.<br>
<br>
          1.                   Remove the embryo from the chorion. 
                                           Sperm tends to stick to the chorion, and
                                           sperm DNA can be amplified in a PCR
                                           reaction; it is therefore essential to remove
                                           the chorion, especially if you expect the
                                           genotype of the haploid embryo to differ
                                           (i.e. mutant) from that of the UV-treated
                                           sperm (usually wild
                                           type).<br>
<br>
          2.                   Transfer embryo into microfuge tube,
                                           remove liquid with Pasteur pipette, rinse by
                                           adding some dH<em sub>2</em>O, and
                                           remove as much liquid as possible with
                                           drawn-out Pasteur pipette. 
                                           <br>
 <br>
          3.                   Add 50 &#181;l extraction buffer and incubate at
                                           50&#176;C for about 3 hr.  Mix occasionally. 
                                           <br>
<br>
          <B><I>DNA Extraction buffer</B></I><br>
<br>
10 mM Tris pH 8.2<BR>
10 mM EDTA<BR> 
200 mM NaCl<BR>
0.5% SDS<BR>
200 &#181;g/ml proteinase K<br>
<br>
<br>
          4.                   Add 100 &#181;l EtOH, mix, and place on ice for
                                           20-30 min.  <br>
<br>
          5.                   Centrifuge in microfuge for 10 min, remove
                                           supernatant and add 200 &#181;l 70% EtOH. 
                                           Spin again for 2 min, remove liquid and dry
                                           pellet.<br>
<br>
          6.                   Resuspend the DNA in 20 &#181;l TE, store at -
                                           20&#176;C.<br>
<br>
          7.                   Proceed with PCR reaction.  Usually 1/4 to
                                           1/2 (5-10 &#181;l) of the DNA preparation from
                                           one embryo is
                                           sufficient.<br>

<br>
          This protocol is essentially that of Sambrook et al. (i.e. Maniatis),
described on page 9.16 ff, of Vol. 2.  References, modifications, and alternatives
can be found there.  Genomic DNA prepared by this method can be used for all
purposes, including construction of libraries.  Care should be taken to carry out
all mixing and resuspension steps gently; do not vortex.  Store DNA at 4&#176;C, do
not freeze.<br>
<br>
          1.                   Place embryos, tissue or adult fish into
                                           suitable container, remove all liquid and
                                           quick-freeze in liquid nitrogen.  If desired,
                                           specimen can be stored at -
                                           80&#176;C.<br>
<br>
          2.                   Prepare extraction buffer.  About 10 ml per
                                           1 g of material or 10 volumes per volume of
                                           ground fish (see 3, below) is appropriate. 
                                           Have extraction buffer ready in 50 ml
                                           plastic tube or a small
                                           beaker.<br>
<br>
<br>
          <B><I>Genomic DNA extraction buffer</I></B><br>
<br>
10 mM Tris pH 8<br>
100 mM EDTA pH 8<br>
0.5% SDS<br>
200 &#181;g/ml Proteinase K<br>
<br>
<br>
          3.                   Grind material into a powder using a high
                                           speed blender or mortar and pestle, keeping
                                           it frozen in liquid nitrogen.  When finished,
                                           allow the liquid nitrogen to
                                           evaporate.<br>
<br>
          4.                   Slowly add powder to extraction buffer,
                                           allowing it to spread and wet on the surface
                                           of the buffer.  Then shake to submerge
                                           material.<br>
<br>
          5.                   Incubate at 50&#176;C for at least 3 hr (up to
                                           overnight) with occasional gentle
                                           swirling.<br>
<br>
          6.                   Cool solution to room temperature and
                                           extract two times with one volume of
                                           equilibrated phenol.  MIX GENTLY until
                                           an emulsion has formed; separate phases by
                                           centrifugation at 3000-5000xg for 10 min. 
                                           Remove aqueous phase carefully using a
                                           wide-bore pipette.<br>
<br>
          7.                   Extract a third time with
                                           phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol
                                           (25:24:1), centrifuge, then transfer aqueous
                                           phase into fresh tube and add NaCl to a
                                           final concentration of 200 mM.  Overlay
                                           with 2 volumes of ethanol by slowly letting
                                           it run down the side of the tube.  Swirl the
                                           tube gently until the solution is thoroughly
                                           mixed.  The DNA will precipitate
                                           immediately and should be easily
                                           visible.<br>
<br>
          8.                   Over a Bunsen burner, seal the end of a
                                           Pasteur pipette and melt it into a U-shape. 
                                           Remove the precipitated DNA using the
                                           Pasteur pipette and transfer it into a tube
                                           containing 70% ethanol.  Let DNA stand in
                                           70% ethanol for about 5 min and gently
                                           move it around from time to time using the
                                           Pasteur pipette.<br>
<br>
          9.                   Remove the DNA from the 70% ethanol
                                           with the Pasteur pipette, let excess liquid
                                           drip off, and place the Pasteur pipette with
 DNA sticking to it inverted into a microfuge rack.  Let the DNA air dry for 5
min. <br>
<br>
<B>NOTE:</B>                         If the DNA precipitate becomes fragmented in the 70%
                                     ethanol solution and fails to stick to the pipette,
                                     centrifuge the tube for 5 min at 5000xg to pellet the
                                     DNA.  Then remove as much ethanol as possible.  Let
                                     the DNA air dry until the last visible traces of ethanol
                                     have evaporated.<br>
<br>
          10.                  Resuspend the DNA in an appropriate
                                           volume (5-10 ml per gram of starting
                                           material) of 10 mM Tris pH 8, 5 mM
                                           EDTA and 100 &#181;g/ml (DNAse free) RNAse
                                           A.  Genomic DNA is hard to resuspend, this
                                           may take several hours.  Place DNA
                                           solution at 37&#176;C and gently mix and swirl
                                           from time to time.<br>
<br>
          11.                  Extract the DNA solution once with
                                           phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (as
                                           above) and transfer aqueous phase to fresh
                                           tube.<br>
<br>
          12.                  Add 0.1 volume of 7.5 M ammonium
                                           chloride and overlay with two volumes of
                                           ethanol.  Precipitate DNA by slowly
                                           inverting tube until solution is thoroughly
                                           mixed.  Repeat steps 8 and 9.  Rinse twice
                                           in 70% ethanol.<br>
<br>
          13.                  Resuspend DNA in TE, usually 1-2 ml per
                                           g of starting material is good.  Resuspending
                                           can be facilitated by warming the DNA
                                           solution to 50&#176;C.<br>
<br>
          14.                  Determine the concentration by measuring
                                           OD at 260 nm in a spectrophotometer. 1 OD
                                           unit is 50 &#181;g/ml.
