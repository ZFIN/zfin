Feed manually ground dry or moist trout pellets (Ranger 1/4 inch brood food or Oregon wet pellets) as well as dry flake food like Tetra brand (available at most pet stores).  Add enough food to each tank so that all the fish get some and all the food is eaten within 5 minutes.  Feed adults at least twice a day although multiple light feedings allow the fish better opportunity to utilize the food.  The best possible food for breeding adults is live adult brine shrimp.
