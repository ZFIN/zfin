GENERAL METHODS FOR ZEBRAFISH CARE</h1>
<H2>Shipping Fish</H2>
<i>(Source: S. Russell)</i>
<p>
Fish and embryos can be shipped anywhere around the world.  The following is a list of materials needed:
<ul>
<li>Styrofoam box with tight-fitting lid
<li>Matching cardboard box
<li>Plastic garbage bags
<li>One quart plastic bags (for adult fish)	
<li>Rubber bands
<li>Clean system water
</ul>
<p>
<H3><b>Packing adult fish</b></H3>

Line styrofoam box with garbage bag.  Fill quart bags half full of system water.  Use two bags, one inside the other.  Put the adult fish into the bags, and label the inner bag.  Tie off both bags individually with the rubber bands.  Be sure to trap as much air as possible in the bag.  Place the bags of fish in the styrofoam box.  Close the box, and seal it with tape.  Place the styrofoam box in the cardboard box, and seal it.  Address the box, and place a notice on it stating that the box contains live fish.  Be sure to include a return address.
<p>
<H3><b>Packing embryos and very young fish</b></H3>
Even very young embryos can be shipped, but a disadvantage with shipping embryos is that collecting the eggs and sending the fish must be carefully timed.  Since the fish must be fed beginning on the fourth day after fertilization, the embryos should be collected and sent on the day they are fertilized.  This is often impractical.  Instead, the fish can be sent the following day.  This still leaves three days for the fish to arrive at their destination.  Appropriate foods (e.g., paramecia) must be provided immediately upon arrival.
<p>
Fish that are to be sent as embryos should be placed in 250 ml tissue culture flasks (e.g. Falcon #3024; Fisher Scientific).  The flask should be filled with approximately 150 ml of system water.  The flasks are then packed in a styrofoam box for shipment.  Packing no more than 25 eggs per flask yields minimal loss of eggs in transit.
<p>
The same packing procedure can be used to ship young (~3-4 weeks) fish.

<p>
<H3><b>Domestic Shipping</b></H3>
It is best to use a well established shipping company to transport fish. Expeditors International, with offices in Portland, is an excellent company. These folks know the details of making plane connections and customs intricacies, and are very good at avoiding delays.  They also are familiar with our special needs, and have taken the time to tour the facility to learn about us.  Shipping fish through Expeditors is merely a matter of giving them a call and telling them where and when the package is to be shipped.  They have a courier pick the package up at the facility, and can even arrange to have the fish delivered to the door of the recipient (although it is usually faster to have the consignee pick up the package at the airport).

<p>
As an alternative, fish can be shipped by the US Postal Service Express Mail or by Federal Express.  Federal Express is not the preferred choice, because they often ship their packages in unpressurized compartments.
<p>
<H3><b>Overseas shipments</b></H3>

Shipping fish overseas is trickier because of customs regulations.  A letter stating that the fish are disease-free is almost always required.  It should be printed on Institute letterhead.  Official-looking stamps can be helpful in speeding through customs.  The shipping company will provide information  about the requirements for shipments to specific countries.
<br>Because overseas shipments take longer than those sent within the States, it is important to stress that the package contains live animals, and should be expedited.  Label the container that it should not be x-rayed.
<p>
<H3><b>Record Keeping</b></H3>
It is important to keep track of which fish are sent where.  Fish to be shipped should receive stock numbers, in the event that the information is needed in the future.  A record is kept for each shipment, and includes:
	<ul>
	<li>Name, address, and phone number of the recipient
	<li>Stock number, genotype, age, and number of males and female fish sent
	<li>Shipping particulars:
	<ul><li>	Departure, arrival times and locations
		<li>Airline and flight information
		<li>Cost of shipment
		<li>Shipping company used
	</ul>Any special instructions given to the recipient.
</ul>

<H3><b>Examples of Paperwork</b></H3>
