<BR>
<BR>1.	Obtain eggs as described in the section Embryo Production By In Vitro Fertilization (see page 1).
<BR>2.	Place a 70 &micro;l droplet of ice-cold 100% Hank's saline next to the eggs on the petri dish.
<BR>3.	Remove the capillary from the liquid nitrogen and thaw for a few seconds in air. 
<BR>4.	Expel the sperm into the droplet of 100% Hank's saline with gentle pressure, mix gently, and then mix with the eggs. 
<BR>5.	Let sit 0.5-1 min, then add 0.75 ml fish water and let it sit another 2 min. 
<BR>6.	Add more water to bring the solution level up to about half the volume of the petri dish.
<BR>	The above recipe assumes an average of 10-11 mm of sperm. To calculate the amount of thawing medium needed for different amounts of sperm:

	<H3>Sperm Thawing Medium</H3>
<BR>a.	Measure the mm of sperm + freezing medium (sm) in the capillary.
<BR>b.	Convert to volume:
<p>	   [10 ul (capillary vol.)  x  mm sm] / 90 mm (capillary length) =  vol (ul)
<p>
c.	Multiply the calculated volume x 10 and use that much 100% Hank's saline for thawing.
