<I>(Source: C. Walker)</I>
	<p>Young zebrafish of mixed sexes can be treated with testosterone to yield predominantly males.  This is a useful procedure to ensure having enough males for breeding, particularly in lines which usually yield mostly females.
<H3>Source:</H3>
17-a-methyltestosterone; MW 302.5; Sigma #M-7252; final concentration = 1.7 x 10-7 M.
<H3>Stock solution:</H3>
150 mg testosterone in 50 ml Absolute Alcohol (very soluble).  Keep in -20C freezer.
<H3>Treatment solution:</H3>
Add 10 &#181;l of stock solution to 600 ml egg water slowly while stirring.  Stir ~10 min.
<H3>Procedure:</H3>
<BR>1.	Remove chorions from 24 h embryos
<BR>2.	Add ~25 embryos to 50 ml fresh testosterone solution in a 250 ml beaker; add as little water as possible (i.e. 1 drop).  Leave overnight.
<BR>3.	The next day, add 50 ml fresh testosterone solution.
<BR>4.	On each consecutive day, replace 1/2 of the testosterone solution with fresh testosterone solution.
<BR>5.	Feed embryos normally.
<BR>6.	Continue treatment until 15 days of development, moving fry from beakers to mouse cages at 9 days (see Raising Larvae in a Nursery, page 1).
<BR>7.	At 15 days, remove most of the testosterone solution and add system water.  Continue diluting during the regular daily cleaning.
<P>CAUTION:  Avoid contact with testosterone.  Rinse well if you get it on your skin.  Rinse glassware, etc. very well.
<P>NOTE:  Embryos need to be put in testosterone solution by 24 hrs.  If treated later, some will develop as females.
