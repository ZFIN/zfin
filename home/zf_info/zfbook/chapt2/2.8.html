                        (Source: C. Walker and G. Streisinger)<br>
<br>
<B><A NAME="1"><I>Overview of in vitro
fertilization</A>:</I><br>
</B><br>
        Large numbers of synchronously developing embryos can be obtained by
<em u></em><I>in vitro</I> fertilization.  Maintain breeding males and
females on a daily schedule as described in the Zebrafish Breeding Schedule
for Maximal Embryo Production (page 2.4).  Gametes are expressed from
breeding adults by gentle pressure.  The sperm are maintained in Hank's saline. 
The gametes are mixed together in a petri dish.  When water is added to the egg-
sperm mixture, fertilization takes place very rapidly in 20 to 60 seconds.  After
1 minute, the sperm are no longer active.  The clutch of embryos is fertilized
essentially synchronously and develops synchronously during the early cleavage
stages if maintained at constant temperature.<br>
<br>
1.  Transfer the males and females into separate
            holding tanks during the late afternoon of the day before beginning
            the <I>in vitro</I> fertilization.
<br><BR>
2.  One half hour before "dawn" for the females, collect sperm from the males.
<OL>
<LI>Anesthetize the male fish by immersion in
                         tricaine (see <a href="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt10.html">RECIPES</a>, Chapter 10). 
                         They can be lifted out of the anesthetic with a plastic
                         spoon.
<LI>Rinse in fish water, and place belly up in a slit
                         in a damp sponge.  
<LI>Gently blot the genital region with a kimwipe
                         so that no water is present (<B>very important:</B>
                         water activates sperm).
<LI>Stroke the sides of the fish gently but firmly
                         with smooth (Millipore) forceps.  
<LI>As the milky sperm come out of the genital
                         pore, collect them in a microcapillary using gentle suction. 
<LI>Pool the sperm from several males in ice-cold,
                full-strength Hank's saline.  Sperm from 5-10 males is
                adequate for fertilization of several hundred eggs.  Sperm in
                cold Hanks's will continue to fertilize eggs efficiently for up to
                90 minutes.  "Eyeball" the concentration of sperm, collecting
                enough to make a cloudy suspension.</OL>
 3.  When the normal light cycle begins in the morning,
            start collecting eggs. 
<OL>
<LI>Anesthetize a female in
                tricaine.
<LI>Rinse in fish water and blot "damp-dry" on a
                paper towel.  Excess water will swell the eggs and prevent
                fertilization.
<LI>Place the female in a 35 mm plastic petri dish
                and with damp (not wet) fingers, press gently but firmly on the
                belly.  If she is prepared to lay eggs, they will come out quite
                easily.
<LI>Gather the eggs with a spatula and return the
                female to water.  Good eggs are a yellowish, translucent color,
                whereas eggs that have remained in the female too long are
                white and watery (see below).  To ensure getting good eggs,
                collect them during the first 90 min after
                "dawn".</OL>
4.  Fertilize the eggs.
<OL>
<LI>Add 30-50 &#181;l of the sperm suspension in
                Hank's to the eggs.
<LI>Mix gently.
<LI>Add about 0.5-0.75 ml of system water and
                after 1-2 minutes, add 2 mls more water.  The actual time of
                fertilization is when the first water is added to the eggs. 
                Typically, 60-90% of the eggs are fertilized in an <I>in
                vitro</I> cross.
</OL>
    Depending on health and unknown factors, females will produce:<DIR>
<LI><I>good eggs</I> (slightly
                yellowish, granular-looking eggs);
                
<LI><I>bad eggs </I> (eggs already
                broken down, whitish and rather like baby cereal);
                
<LI><I>mixed eggs</I> (some good
                eggs mixed with bad eggs);
                and
<LI><I>no
                eggs</I><br>
</DIR>
        It is possible that females produce and reabsorb their eggs every day
and the majority of females are synchronized to lay their eggs at
"dawn".
        After being used in an <I>in vitro</I> experiment, males should be
rested for 3 weeks and females rested for 4 weeks before being squeezed again. 
They may be used for natural crosses during that rest time.<br><BR>
        Occasionally fish die in an <I>in vitro</I> experiment.  Care should
be taken not to leave fish in tricaine for too long.  Sometimes fish can be revived
from too long exposure to tricaine by irrigating their gills with water.  Also, extra
care should be taken not to damage the gills.  Handling fish "front-to-back" when
using spoons and spatulas is helpful.  One characteristic of sick fish is that their
gills hemorrhage easily and the fish die after exposure to tricaine.
<A NAME="2"><I><H3>General Procedures and Overview</H3></I></A></B>    <B>Why Do We Squeeze?</B> <br>
<br>
1.  To obtain large numbers of
            synchronously developing embryos. (Average
            clutch size: 100 embryos)<BR>
<br>
2.  To obtain haploid embryos, such as when
            identifying heterozygous mutants.<br>
<br>
        3.  To obtain embryos for Early Pressure. <br>
<br>
        4.  To obtain embryos for Heat Shock. <br>
 <br>
    <B>Setting Up For A Squeezing Experiment</B> <br>
<br>
        1.  Set up is done after 3:30 p.m. the afternoon before the experiment.
            <br>
<br>
        2.  Tanks of prospective fish for squeezing are chosen by:  <DIR>
<LI>Appearance of fish: Females should look large and fat in the belly. Males should look yellow and spry.
<LI>Elapsed time since fish have been squeezed: Fish should not be squeezed more than once/month.  Longer intervals between squeezing are better. 
</DIR>
        3.  Fish are separated during the night in
            holding tanks.  Males are put into tanks on a light cycle
            &#189; hour earlier than females to allow time for
            obtaining sperm in the morning.<br>
<br>
        4.  Materials to gather:<br>

<LI>Stereo microscope 
<LI>Sperm collection apparatus 
<LI>20 ml beaker of Hank's solution
<LI>Finger bowl with fish water
<LI>Lamp

<LI>Male fish 
<LI>A fish net 
</DIR>
    <B>Preparation</B><br>
<br>
        1.  Estimate the number of egg clutches to be obtained. <br>
<br>
        2.  Measure 0.05 ml of Hank's for every clutch of eggs anticipated.<br>
<br>
        3.  Put the measured Hank's in the small test
            tube, cover with cork and put in ice.<br>
<br>
        4.  Put some of the remaining Hank's solution
            into the 10 ml beaker.<br>
<br>
        5.  Put the capillary tube of the sperm
            collecting apparatus into the Hank's solution in the 10 ml
            beaker when not collecting sperm during the
            procedure.<br>
<br>
    <B>Procedure</B><br>
<br>
        1.  Remove two fish from the plastic holding
            container with net and place into the 250 ml beaker
            containing the tricaine solution.  Repeat this for the other
            250 ml beaker.<br>
<br>
        2.  When gill movement has slowed, remove
            one fish with the plastic spoon.<br>
<br>
        3.  Rinse this fish in the water in the finger
            bowl and place it upside down in the small sponge in the
            plastic dish.<br>
<br>
        4.  Gently wipe the region of the anal fin with
            the corner of a Kimwipe.<br>
<br>
        5.  Place the dish with the fish under the
            objective of the microscope, with the light illuminating the
            fish, especially the region of the anal fin.<br>
<br>
        6.  With the capillary tube of the sperm
            collecting apparatus, gently push aside the anal fins to
            expose the anus.<br>
<br>
        7.  Using the forceps gently squeeze the sides
            of the fish at a point just anterior to the anal fins, collecting
            the sperm with the capillary tube.  When finished return
            the fish to the finger bowl or recovery
            container.<br>
<br>
        8.  When you have collected sperm from 2-3
            fish, add them to the Hanks solution in the small test tube
            in the ice bucket.<br>
<br>
        9.  Repeat until you have collected the required
            amount of sperm.<br>
<br>
        10. Keep the small test tube with the sperm and
            Hank's solution in the ice.  This helps prolong the viability
            of the sperm.<br>
 <br>
<br><B><A NAME="4"><I><H3>Squeezing Females</H3></I></A></B>    <B>Materials Needed:</B><br>
<br>
        Tricaine solution in two 250 ml beakers <br>
        Sperm in Hank's solution <br>
        One package, 35 mm petri dishes <br>
        50 &#181;l micropipettes (Drummond Wiretrol)<br>
        Plungers for micropipettes<br>
        Egg Water<br>
        2 18mm x 150mm test tubes <br>
        2-1 ml pipettes and a 25 ml pipette in a liter beaker of fish water<br>
        Clean tank water <br>
        Female fish <br>
 <br>
    <B>Preparation</B><br>
<br>
        1.  Fill the large test tubes with egg water.<br>
<br>
        2.  Put one plunger into each test tube.<br>
<br>
        3.  Fill finger bowls with clean tank water.<br>
<br>
    <B>Procedure</B><br>
<br>
        1.  Place two females into the tricaine solution
            in each of the two 250 ml beakers.<br>
<br>
        2.  When gill movement has slowed, remove
            one of the fish with the plastic spoon.
            <br>
<br>
        3.  Rinse the fish in the water in the finger
            bowl. <br>
<br>
        4.  Gently place the fish on a paper towel to
            dry briefly. <br>
<br>
        5.  Using the spoon, transfer the fish into a
            small plastic dish. <br>
<br>
        6.  Slightly dampen your fingers. <br>
<br>
        7.  Place one finger of one hand on the dorsal
            side of the fish.  <br>
<BR>        8.  Using one finger of the other hand express
            the eggs by gently pressing on the ventral side of the fish,
            starting just behind the pectoral fins and moving toward the
            tail.  Only gentle pressure is needed. If the fish has eggs
            they will come out easily.  If gentle pressure fails to
            produce eggs do not continue to squeeze harder.  Extra
            squeezing may injure the fish. <br>
<br>
        9.  If eggs are obtained, use the metal spatula
            to gently move them away from the fish's body.  Then
            slide the fish out of the dish.<br>
<br>
        10. Put the fish into a recovery container to
            revive.<br>
<br>
        11. When eggs are obtained by squeezing,
            cover them with the lid to the dish.<br>
<br>
        12. Repeat this for the remaining
            fish.<P>
<A NAME="5"><I><H3>In Vitro Fertilization</I></A></H3></B>

    <B>Procedure</B><br>
<br>
        1.  Move to the fertilization station and remove
            a plunger from the water in the test tube.  Remove a
            capillary tube from its container and insert the plunger into
            the end of the capillary with the green mark.
            <br>
<br>
        2.  Push the plunger down almost to the end of
            the tube, leaving about 0.5 cm of air space.
            <br>
<br>
        3.  Remove the cork from the test tube
            containing the sperm and insert the capillary tube with the
            plunger into the sperm. <br>
<br>
        4.  Draw the plunger part way out of the tube
            to draw sperm up to the black line on the capillary.  Be
            sure to leave air space between the end of the plunger and
            the sperm. <br>
<br>
        5.  Expel the sperm onto the eggs by pushing
            the plunger all the way through the capillary so that the tip
            of the plunger extends out of the end of the capillary.
            <br>
<br>
        6.  Gently mix the sperm and eggs with the tip
            of the plunger. <br>
<br>
        7.  Using the 1 ml pipette, add 1 ml of egg
            water to the egg/sperm mixture.  This activates the sperm
            so that they can fertilize the eggs.  The time of fertilization
            occurs when the WATER is added, not when the sperm is
            added. <br>
<br>
        8.  Cover the dish with its lid.
            <br>
<br>
        9.  Allow a few minutes for fertilization to
            complete, then add more egg water, approximately 2
            ml.<br>
<br>
<br>
<I><B>Experiment Clean Up</I><br>
</B><br>
    When fish are returned to their tanks, they should be marked with a sticker
indicating the date used.  Rinse spatulas, wiretrols, and spoons with tap water. 
Put away all materials in original places.  Enter the number and quality
(G,B,M,N) of eggs obtained in <I>Experiment Done</I> notebook.<br>
<br>
<br>
<I><B>Follow Up of Embryos</I><br>
<br>
</B>        Embryos should be left alone for one hour after fertilization.
Then:<br>
<br>
        1.  Count fertile embryos.  <br>
<br>
        2.  Remove dead and infertile embryos.<br>
<br>
        3.  Transfer groups of 25 embryos into 300 ml
            beakers with 100 ml of fish water each.  
            <br>
<br>
<br>    <B><I>Morning Following Fertilization</I></B><br>
<br>
        1.  Sort, count, and record the numbers of
AA/BB, B/CD and dead embryos:<br>
<br>
AA = Embryos are perfect diploids.<br>
A = Perfect haploid embryos.<br>
BB = Diploid embryos that have small imperfections such as a bent tail or one eye.<BR>
B = Very abnormal embryos that have a head, body axis and some sort of tail, but obviously will not survive.<BR>
C/D = Embryos that are yolks with masses of cells on them.<br><br>
        2. Screen according to particular experiment or mutation.
