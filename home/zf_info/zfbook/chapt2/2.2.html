        This method requires more work, but is especially well suited for
production of large numbers of embryos (upwards of 1000 embryos per tank)
once or twice a week.  A continuous supply of embryos can be obtained with this
method by adding more tanks of fish and rotating the schedule among the tanks. 
Although zebrafish reach sexual maturity in 10-12 weeks, the breeding fish should be between 7 and 18 months of age for maximum embryo production.  Keep males and
females in separate tanks with up to 8 females or 16 males per 10 gallon tank. 
The tanks should be cleaned at least once per day by siphoning, replacing about
1/3 of the water.  Feed the fish 2-3 times per day.  On the day before you want
embryos, 1-2 hr before the end of the light period, feed the fish and clean the
tanks.  Then transfer the males into the tank with the females at a ratio of 1 male
to 2 females (excellent results come from 4 males and 8 females).  Add marbles
to cover the bottom of the tank a single layer deep.  After the beginning of the
next light cycle, collect the embryos by siphoning the bottom of the tank (see <A HREF="2.3.html">Embryo Collection</A>).<br><BR>
        After collecting the embryos, transfer the males back into their tank, scoop
out the marbles with a net and clean them thoroughly by autoclaving or by
soaking them for 4 hr in a 10% solution of bleach followed by a 4 hr rinse in
running water.  Do not collect embryos more than two days in a row from the
same fish and remove the marbles for at least a week between embryo collections. 
Transfer all fish to new aquaria every 10 days and scrub and bleach the old
tanks.
