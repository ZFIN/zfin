        Zebrafish are photoperiodic in their breeding, and produce
embryos every morning, shortly after sunrise.  For continuous production of a
relatively small number of embryos (30-50 per tank per day) use an equal number
of males> (longer, slimmer, and more yellow especially on the belly) and
females (plumper and more silvery).  Control the day-night cycle
with an automatic timer (14 hr light/10 hr dark) and keep the fish well fed with
a rich supply of food like liver paste and live brine shrimp
(see <A HREF="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt1/1.2.html">Food</a>,
Chapter 1).  If the
tank is in a room that must be used during the "night", cover it with a black
plastic drape to keep out ambient light and provide a separate tank light, inside
the drape, that is controlled by the automatic timer.  Be sure to check the
temperature of the water with the tank covered; you may have to adjust the heater
to compensate for the light.  Cover the entire bottom of the tank with a single
layer of marbles to keep the fish from eating the newly spawned eggs.  Each
morning, siphon the bottom of the tank for embryos as described in <A HREF="2.3.html">Embryo Collection</A>. 
If you don't need embryos for a time, remove the marbles to let the fish "rest"
and feed much less food.  Otherwise the fish will get fat and breed poorly.
