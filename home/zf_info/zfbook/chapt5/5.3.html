1.	Mount embryos in 1.2% agar (see <b><A HREF="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt4/4.3.html">Agar Mounting</A></b>, Chapter 4).<p>
2.	Use a razor blade to cut flat faces in the agar approximately 1 mm from the embryos on the side to be injected and on the side directly opposite.<p>

 3.	Slide the agar containing the embryos until it rests against the edge of the bridged coverslip. Glue it down with some extra agar and cover with Ringers.<p>
4.Remove wedges of agar with a platinum wire over the embryos so that the pipette has free access.  In older embryos (>24 h) use the wire to tease a small hole in the skin for the pipette to enter.<p>
5.	Place the embryos under a high-powered water immersion lens (e.g. 40x) with as large a working distance as possible and use Nomarski optics during the injection.<p>
6.	Dissolve 2 mg/ml DiI in dimethylformamide (or ethanol), in a microfuge tube.  Filter by centrifuging through an 0.2 &#181;m filter.  Store at 
4&#176;C.  This solution remains stable and can be used for months.<p>
7.	Backfill sharp glass micropipettes (tip resistances of approximately 100 megohms) with the dye.  When the tip is filled, backfill the remainder of the pipette with 0.2 M KCl.<p>
8.	Insert the pipette into a holder (e.g. WPI) attached to a current source.<p>
9.	Mount the pipette in the holder on a micromanipulator that allows you to bring it down to the embryo at an angle.  Once the embryo and the pipette are in focus, use the stage for the delicate movements.<p>
10.	Punch the pipette through the skin quickly. <p>
11.	Bring the tip into contact with the cell to be labeled.<p>
12.	Pass current through the pipette to an agar bridge ground electrode (see <b><i><A HREF="5.2.html#bridges">Agar bridged ground wires</A></i></b>,) gradually increasing the current until dye is emitted.<b><i><p>
<H3>For labeling neuronal processes</H3></i></b>	<p>
Monitor the labeling directly through the microscope. Labeled axons will become visible immediately near the injection site.   Wait 30 min or more to see more distant labeling.<b><i><p>
<H3>For lineage tracing</H3></i></b>	<p>
Monitor the labeling with an image intensifier and camera.  Labeled cell bodies will become visible slowly as ghost-like figures against the background. Initially, labeled cells seem to be very sensitive to illumination, but less so later.<b><p>
