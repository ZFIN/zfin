<H3>To prepare 24 h Embryos:</H3>

1.	Dechorionate 24 h embryos.
<P>
2.	Transfer into 10-2 M (4 mg/ml) freshly made colchicine.
<P>
3.	Incubate at 28.5C for 90 min in the dark.
<P>
4.	At room temperature (~21&bull;C), rinse the embryos and transfer embryos into 1.1% NaCitrate.  Puncture the yolk and start a timer.
<P>
5.	Dissect away the yolk.
<P>
6.	At 8 min, transfer the dish to ice for an additional 8 min.
<P>
7.	Transfer the embryos with as little citrate as possible into a 3:1 mixture of methanol:acetic acid.
<P>
8.	Let stand 20 min and change the methanol acetic solution.  Store in freezer overnight.

<H3>To prepare 24 h spreads:</H3>

1.	Pick up an embryo with forceps.
<P>
2.	Blot it until partially dry.
<P>
3.	Transfer the embryo into a watch glass containing 3 drops of 50% acetic acid and mince with forceps 1 min.
<P>
4.	Triturate the suspended cells two times in a 50 ul wiretrol microcapillary.
<P>
5.	Drop droplets of the cell suspension onto a slide, prewarmed to 50C, and quickly pull the liquid back up into the wiretrol.  Drop ~6 droplets per slide.
<P>
6.	Expel the remaining liquid in the wiretrol onto the watchglass, mix and drop onto another slide, etc. for about 4 or 5 slides per embryo. This procedure will gradually dilute the cells yielding a range of cell densities on the slides.
<P>
7.	Leave slides at 50C for about 10 min to completely dry.
<P>
8.	Stain in Giemsa for 30 min:
<DIR>
		Giemsa:
<DIR>
<BR>			4 mls Giemsa Stock (Sigma Diagnostics)
<BR>				4 mls 0.5 M Na Phosphate pH7
<BR>				200 mls distilled water
</DIR></DIR>
9.	Rinse twice with dH2O.

<H3>To prepare blastulae:</H3>

1.	At 60-100 min after fertilization, remove the chorions with pronase:
<DIR>
<LI>		Drain eggs; add 5 ml of 0.5 mg/ml pronase for 3.5 min
<LI>		Dilute eggs with 200 ml of 8x water.  Rinse three times more with 200 ml washes of 8x water.
<LI>			8x water = 12 ml stock salts per liter dH2O
<LI>			Stock salts = 40 g Instant Ocean per liter dH2O
</DIR>
2.	Transfer the embryos into 3.5 cm petri dishes at a density of 25 per dish in 8x water.
<P>
3.	Break the yolks by lifting the embryos to the surface on a sharp probe. This will produce a ball of cells.
<P>
4.	At 120 min after fertilization, transfer the cells to 1.1% Na citrate at RT for 10 min.
<P>
5.	Fix in 3:1 methanol:acetic acid for 60 min and then change to fresh 3:1.
<P>
6.	Store in freezer.

<H3>To prepare blastulae spreads:</H3>

1.	Transfer the blastulae in 3:1 onto an ice cold slide.
<P>
2.	Tease apart with fine needles or forceps.
<P>
3.	Add small droplets of 50% acetic acid and flame the slide three times over a Bunsen burner.
<P>
4.	Transfer the slide to a 50C slide warmer.
<P>
5.	Stain with Giemsa for 30 min (see above).
