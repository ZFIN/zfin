1.	Fix fish as desired.<P>

 2.	Wash in fix buffer, 3 times for 5 min each wash.<P>

 3.	Soak fish in 0.3 M sucrose for at least 30 min.  Remove yolk sac from fish with forceps.<P>

 4.	Transfer fish with as little sucrose solution as possible into 17% gelatin in 10% Hank's saline at 37C.<P>

 5.	Swirl the fish to coat it well with gelatin and transfer it with a drop of gelatin onto a 5 mm square piece of glass made by scoring and breaking a clean microscope slide.<P>

 6.	Orient the animal under a dissecting microscope with fine wire or forceps.  The process may be facilitated by warming or cooling the glass plate.<P>

 7.	Fasten the plate to a vibratome chuck with cyanoacrylic glue and clamp the chuck in the vibratome.<P>

 8.	Surround the tissue with cold 0.3 M sucrose.  Use frozen cubes of sucrose to maintain the temperature.<P>

 9.	Sections can be cut 25-40 um thick with this technique. Pick them up with brush and transfer to cold, subbed slides.<P>

10.		Remove excess sucrose with a Kimwipe and allow the slides to dry.  They should be processed within a few hours.<P>
