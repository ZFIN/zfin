1.	Fix animals as desired.<P>

2.	Wash in fix buffer, 3 times for 5 min each wash.<P>

3.	Melt an aliquot of agar-sucrose solution (1.5% agar, 5% sucrose) and cool to 4C.<P>

4.	Transfer an animal with a drop of fix buffer to a flexible plastic well.  Remove excess fluid and add agar-sucrose to cover the animal.  Use a fine wire or toothpick to move the animal around so that it is well coated and to orient it.  Set aside until the agar has solidified (5 to 10 min).<P>

5.	Remove the block from the mold and trim with a razor blade on a hard surface according to the desired plane of sectioning. Leave at least 2-3 mm of agar around the tissue and 3-4 mm of agar below the tissue where it will be frozen to the cryostat chuck.<P>

6.	Place the trimmed agar block containing the animal into 30% sucrose and store at 4C until the block has sunk.  For 1 to 2 day old fish this may be as short as a few hours.<P>

7.	When ready to section, make a slightly raised platform by freezing a layer of OCT compound (Tissue Tek, Miles) to the cryostat chuck.  Add a drop of OCT to the platform, position the agar block and lower the whole unit slowly into a container of liquid nitrogen.  Gradual even freezing is necessary to avoid cracking the block.<P>

8.	Equilibrate the block to the cryostat temperature before sectioning.  Sections 10 to 40 &#181;m thick can be cut with this procedure.  Pick them up onto subbed slides and dry them on a 26C hot plate.<P>
