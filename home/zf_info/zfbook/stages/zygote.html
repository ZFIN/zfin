The newly fertilized egg is in the zygote period until the first cleavage  occurs <A HREF="figs/fig3.html">(Fig. 3)</A>, about 40 minutes after fertilization.  The zygote is about 0.7 mm in diameter at the time of fertilization.  We include only a single stage, however many changes are occurring, and one could easily subdivide the period (see Hisoaka &amp; Battle, 1958).
<p>
<b>Stages During the Zygote Period<p>

1-cell stage (0 h):</b>  The chorion swells and lifts away from the newly fertilized egg <A HREF="figs/fig3.html">(Fig. 3A)</A>.  Fertilization also activates cytoplasmic movements, easily evident within about 10 minutes.  Non-yolky cytoplasm begins to stream towards the animal pole, segregating the blastodisc from the clearer yolk granule-rich vegetal cytoplasm <A HREF="figs/fig3.html">(Fig. 3B)</A>.  This segregation continues during early cleavage stages.
