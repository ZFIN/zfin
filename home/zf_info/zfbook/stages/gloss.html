adaxial: </b>paraxial mesoderm subregion developing just adjacent to the chorda mesoderm <b><p>
animal pole</b>: location on the egg where the polar bodies emerge, corresponding to the point of fertilization in fish like zebrafish, just below where the sperm penetrates the chorion through the  micropile (passage way)<b><p>

aortic arch</b>: artery leading from the ventral aorta to the paired radix (root) of the dorsal aorta, or, for the first two arches, to the internal carotid artery; an aortic arch develops in all but the most posterior of the seven pharyngeal arches, and the last four will carry the blood supply to and from the gills<b><p>
AP</b>: anterior-posterior<b><p>
atrium</b>: heart chamber collecting venous blood from the sinus venosus and delivering it to the ventricle; generates the first of each (doubled) heart beat<b><p>

blastodisc</b>: (-disk) dome of cytoplasm (disk-like in the case of larger teleost eggs such as <i>Fundulus</i> and <i>Salmo</i>) that segregates from the yolk towards the animal pole during and after the one cell-stage, and which undergoes cleavage<b><p>
blastomere</b>:  a cell arising during cleavage; the term encompasses the partially cleaved, incomplete "cells" at the blastodisc margin before they collectively form the yolk syncytial layer in the midblastula<b><p>
blastula: </b>classically the single-layered hollow ball of cells formed by cleavage in organisms that show this developmental style; here used to mean a stereoblastula, not hollowed-out, and as a descriptor for the period of development when the blastodisc begins to look ball-like, at the 128-cell stage through the time of onset of gastrulation<b><p>

cerebellum: </b>specialized brain region derived from the dorsal metencephalon (anterior hindbrain, and perhaps including posterior midbrain) and becoming distinctive late in the segmentation period<b><p>

chorda mesoderm</b>: the notochord rudiment<b><p>
chorion</b>: the egg shell<b><p>
cleavage: </b>an early mitotic cell division occurring in the blastodisc, special in that the cell cycles are short in length, are not accompanied by cell growth during interphase, and occur synchronously or metasynchronously with other cleavages of the same number; in the staging series, the cleavage period refers to the period of development encompassing the first 6 six zygotic cell cycles<b><p>
