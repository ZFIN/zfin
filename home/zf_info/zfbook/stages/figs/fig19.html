Fig 19.  Demonstration with lineage tracer that somite 3 makes myotome 3.  The images combine fluorescence due tintracellularly injected rhodamine-dextran and bright field (see Schilling and Kimmel, 1994, for method).  The labeled cell in somite 3 (injected with lineage tracer at the 5-somite stage in <b>A</b>) differentiates into an elongated muscle fiber spanning myotome 3 (at the protruding-mouth stage in <b>B</b>).  The white arrowheads in both panels show the posterior borders of somites (myotomes) 1 and 2. <p>
