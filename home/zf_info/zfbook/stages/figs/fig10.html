Fig 10.   Formation of the yolk syncytial layer (YSL), viewed with Nomarski optics.  <b>A</b>: A marginal blastomere during the tenth interphase (512-cell stage; the arrow indicates its nucleus). <b> B</b>: The nucleus disappears as the cell enters the tenth mitosis, a special one because there is no cytokinesis.  The daughter nuclei then reappear in a common cytoplasm during interphase 11.  During very early interphase the nuclei are globular (<b>C</b>), and later, just before entering mitosis again they are large and football-shaped (<b>D</b>). The YSL nuclei continue to disappear during mitoses (<b>E</b>; mitosis 11; note that interphase nuclei are present just in the blastoderm cells and not the YSL, meaning that the blastoderm and YSL are no longer in synchrony,) and reappear during interphases (<b>F</b>; interphase 12) for several mitotic cycles, always within a common syncytium.  From Kimmel and Law (1985b).  Scale bar: 50 &#181;m. <p>
