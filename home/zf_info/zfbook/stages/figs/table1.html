Table 1:  Periods of Early Development</b><p>
<b><p>
Period - h - Description</b><p>
 <b><p>
Zygote</b> - 0 - The newly fertilized egg through the completion of the first zygotic cell cycle<p>
<b>
Cleavage</b> - 3/4 - Cell cycles 2 through 7 occur rapidly and synchronously<p>
<b>
Blastula</b> - 2 1/4 - Rapid, metasynchronous cell cycles (8, 9) give way to lengthened, asynchronous ones at the midblastula transition; epiboly then begins<p>
<b>
Gastrula</b> - 5 1/4 - Morphogenetic movements of involution, convergence and extension form the epiblast, hypoblast and embryonic axis; through the end of epiboly<p>
<b>
Segmentation</b> - 10 - Somites, pharyngeal arch primordia, and neuromeres develop; primary organogenesis; earliest movements; the tail appears<p>
<b>
Pharyngula</b> - 24 - Phylotypic-stage embryo; body axis straightens from its the early curvature about the yolk sac; circulation, pigmentation, and fins begin development<p>
<b>
Hatching</b> - 48 - Completion of rapid morphogenesis of primary organ systems; cartilage development in head and pectoral fin; hatching occurs asynchronously.<p>
<b>
Early larva</b> - 72 - Swim bladder inflates; food-seeking and active avoidance behaviors
