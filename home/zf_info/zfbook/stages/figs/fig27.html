Fig. 27.   Morphogenesis of the otic vesicle.  Left side Nomarski views, dorsal to the top, anterior to the left.  <b>A</b>: The primordium (outlined by arrows) of the inner ear appears as a solid otic placode beside the hindbrain by the 9-somite stage (13.5 h).  <b>B</b>: At the 19-somite stage (18.5 h) the placode has hollowed out intthe otic vesicle.  The arrow indicates the boundary between rhombomeres 4 and 5 along the dorsolateral wall of the hindbrain.  <b>C</b>: Otoliths become prominent in the otic vesicle by the prim-6 stage (25 h).  <b>D</b>: Pec-fin stage at 60 h.  Morphogenesis of the walls of the vesicle have formed the primordia of the semicircular canals dorsally, separated from otolith-containing chambers ventrally.  By this time the vesicle is becoming housed in a refractile cartilaginous capsule.  The dark shadows tthe bottom are out-of-focus melanophores.  Scale bar: 50 &#181;m for A-C, 100 &#181;m for D.<p>
