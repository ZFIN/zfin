<h1 align=center><b>ZFIN Data Submissions</b></h1>

<hr>

<p>ZFIN welcomes direct data submissions. If you would like to make your
unpublished expression or phenotype data available to the community,
you can submit this data to ZFIN using Phenote program.

<p>Phenote allows you to save and load your expression or phenotype
annotations in a tab-delimited file that can be read by Microsoft
Excel. Phenote is advantageous because it uses ZFIN anatomy and
phenotype ontology terms, so you (and ZFIN) don't have to go looking
for them. It also allows basic browsing for terms, which should
expedite annotation. We hope that you will find this new tool helpful
for annotation of mutant phenotypes or gene expression.


<p>You can download the current stable <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/obo/files/Phenote - betas/phenote_1.6_beta9/" title="Phenote: Downloads">Phenote release</a> or check out the more recent <a href=" https://sourceforge.net/projects/obo/files/Phenote - betas/" title="Phenote beta releases">beta versions</a>. The current Phenote beta is known to work on Windows XP, MacOSX, MacOSXI.<br><br></p>

<p>Instructions for using Phenote to submit phenotype or expression data to ZFIN:

<p>Phenote takes a couple of minutes to start up, because it downloads
the most current Gene and zebrafish anatomy ontologies. Phenote
requires <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/">Java</a> on your
machine.  Phenote opens dialog windows in the background as it loads
and needs you to interact with these windows to finish loading.
  Mac users who, for security reasons, use a non-administrator user
account should install Phenote somewhere in their home folder (i.e.,
not in the Applications folder). The beta versions are fully
functional, but there are always some rough edges in betas -
sometimes rows in the main Annotation Table seem to be grayed-out.
Clicking on the missing rows will reveal them again.  You may also
need to configure your firewall software to allow Phenote to access
the newest versions of the ontologies.

<p>After starting up Phenote, under Settings at the top, choose
zfin-phenotype or zfin-expression from the "Set Configuration..."
menu. Then restart Phenote.

<p>Phenote is an ontology smart spreadsheet that can save in a
tab-delimited format which is compatible with MS Excel. Each line at
the bottom is one annotation. As you type in the fields in the upper
half, you will see your annotation filled in the bottom half. To
create a new annotation, click on the new button at the bottom. You
can delete or undo with the buttons at the bottom, and simply
clicking on a line will bring up the annotation at the top of Phenote.

<p>For pub, Image file, gene, and genotype (line name) you can type in
free text.  ZFIN can help you update these later.  If you are
submitting images the file names need to be unique.  ZFIN recommends
using  a combination of feature name and stage to give each file a
unique name e.g.  b215prim5a, b215prim5b b215day5a.


<p>The entity is the anatomical structure in which you see the phenotype
or expression. You can choose between two ontologies, the ZFIN
anatomy ontology, or the Gene Ontology Cellular Component ontology.
There is a type ahead feature for this field, and you can view
details about a given term in the term info box to the right. To make
a more complex structure called a post-composed entity, you hit the
comp button, and get three fields. You might want something like,
GOcc:mitochondrion part_of ZF:neuron. This means that the expression
is in the mitochondria in neurons. The stages are standard from our
<a href="http://zfin.org/zf_info/zfbook/stages/index.html">stage ontology</a>. You
may wish use the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/">EBI lookup</a>
tool and/or the <a href="http://zfin.org/action/anatomy/anatomy-search">ZFIN Anatomy search</a> to find terms by context if you cannot locate them through the
Phenote interface.  If you cannot find the zebrafish structure you
need please fill out the <a href="http://zfin.org/action/anatomy/request-new-anatomy-term">term request form</a>.  Please
include the structure name, the stage the structure becomes apparent
and any other useful information so we can update the ontology.

<p>For phenotypic qualities, you will choose a term from the
<a href="http://obofoundry.org/wiki/index.php/PATO:About">PATO ontology</a>. The
quality is the adjective that describes the phenotype. This ontology
can also be browsed at the
<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/">ontology lookup service</a> if you
cannot find the term you are looking for. Please contact either
<a href="mailto:zfinadmn@zfin.org">ZFIN</a> or submit to the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=76834&amp;atid=595654">PATO tracker</a> if the term you need isn't in PATO.

<p>You can make multiple annotations for the same line; for instance, if
you want to record phenotype in more than one structure. Just hit the
Duplicate button (two overlapping +) and change the field that is different.

<p>To save, hit the "Save Data" button at the bottom, and your data will
be saved as a tab-delimited file.
