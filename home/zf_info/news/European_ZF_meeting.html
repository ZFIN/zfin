<p><big><big><font face="Albertus Medium"><strong>Second European Conference on Zebrafish
Genetics and Development <br>
</strong></font></big><font face="AGaramond"></p>
</font></big>

<p><big><font face="AGaramond">We are currently planning this conference and have made
provisional bookings for the meeting to be held at University College London from the
19-22nd April 2001. <br>
<br>
Before we confirm all of our bookings, I would like to check that our meeting does not
clash with any other major meetings that would attract similar participants. As a
significant proportion of attendees will come from Germany and other European countries,
it is particularly important that there is no major clash with German meetings. However,
we also intend to attract attendees from the <br>
US and Japan and so would also appreciate any information from our colleagues in these
countries. <br>
<br>
We hope to organise a small workshop on imaging, time-lapse, and data analysis techniques
on the 18th and 19th April. <br>
<br>
Please send any thoughts and comments to Steve Wilson (<a href="mailto:s.wilson@ucl.ac.uk">s.wilson@ucl.ac.uk</a>).
Please be aware that it has already been very difficult to arrange the current dates and
so changing them would be a last resort. <br>
<br>
Details of the conference and workshop as they evolve will be accessible at <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/zebrafish-group/">http://www.ucl.ac.uk/zebrafish-group/</a> <br>
