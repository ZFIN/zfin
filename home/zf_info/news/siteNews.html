<h2><a name="NIH">Two funding opportunities at NIH</a></h2>
14 Apr 2008<br>
<div>
 <p>NIH and the Trans-NIH Coordinating Committee have published two new

Program Announcements with special Receipt dates (PARs) soliciting R01
applications for research using zebrafish.  Please note that not all
NIH Institutes and Centers are participating in both of these
solicitations; therefore, only applications relevant to the missions
of participating Institutes and Centers will be considered responsive
to the announcements.  These two new PAR's can be found in the NIH
Guide at the following urls:

<h2><a name="zfmtg">Call for Suggestions for workshops at 2008 Madison meeting</a></h2>
8 Jan 2008<br>
<div>
<p>Planners are working hard on the 2008 international zebrafish meeting (June 25-29,
Madison), and would like to solicit your help. This year's meeting will introduce workshops on specialized topics proposed by the community. These will be organized in two sessions, each with up to 5 workshops running concurrently. Workshops will last two hours, and might consist of 3 or 4 short ( e.g. 15 min) talks, with extensive time for discussion.

<p>We are now asking for the community to propose the topics for these workshops. Topics will be posted on a blog: <a href="http://zf2008workshops.blogspot.com/">http://zf2008workshops.blogspot.com/</a> and we encourage everyone in the community to visit this blog and comment on proposals.

To propose a topic, email <a href="mailto:zfmeeting@gmail.com">zfmeeting@gmail.com</a>. Please include your name and institution. We will invite you to be a blog author so that you can describe your proposal in a new post. If you want to comment on a topic, or propose a change, simply comment on the relevant post (please include your name and institution in your comment).

<h2><a name="zv7-8-07">Zv7 Released in Ensembl</a></h2>
20 Aug 2007<br><div>
     <p>The Sanger Institute has released the seventh zebrafish genome assembly, Zv7, in Ensembl on the 16th of August 2007. The database features repeatmasking, marker placement, alignments with cDNAs, ESTs and peptides, mapped BAC ends, expression patterns, as well as comparative genomics data and data mining tools. The gene build resulted in 21,322 genes, 98 pseudogenes and 4,053 non-coding genes.

<p>Please note that previous Ensembl data built on assembly Zv6 are still available in the Ensembl archives.

<p>The assembly can be downloaded at <a href="ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/assembly/zebrafish/Zv7release">ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/assembly/zebrafish/Zv7release</a> and more information can be found at <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/Zv7_assembly_information.shtml">http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/Zv7_assembly_information.shtml</a>.</p><br>

<h2><a name="zv7">Zv7 Assembly and Pre Ensembl</a></h2>
18 Jul 2007<br>
<div>
      <p>The Sanger Institute has released the seventh zebrafish genome assembly, Zv7, on the 13th of July 2007. This assembly comprises 1.44 Gbp in 5,036 scaffolds. It was generated starting with 1.02 Gbp from 7,823 BAC clones and supplemented with a 5.5x whole genome shotgun assembly. The sequences were integrated using alignments as well as BAC end and marker placement. Over 200 Mbp of duplicated sequence has been removed compared to Zv6. The assembly can be downloaded at <a href="ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/assembly/zebrafish/Zv7release">ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/assembly/zebrafish/Zv7release</a> and more information can be found at <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/Zv7_assembly_information.shtml">http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/Zv7_assembly_information.shtml</a>.

      <p>The Zv7 sequence has been used to generate an Ensembl database available at <a href="http://pre.ensembl.org/Danio_rerio/index.html">http://pre.ensembl.org/Danio_rerio/index.html</a>. This is an extended Pre Ensembl site, providing a full Ensembl gene set for Zv7. A full Ensembl site, providing comparative genomic and data mining tools, will be available for the next Ensembl release in August.

 <h2><a name="papers">Call for Papers - Disease-based review to the American Journal of Medical Genetics</a></h2>
16 Mar 2007<br>
 <div>
 p>Dear ZFIN community,

 <p>We would like to request a call for papers concerning a disease-based review to the American Journal of Medical Genetics.  The focus of this manuscript is understanding human malformation phenotypes using the zebrafish model.   We believe such a review, written for an audience of primarily non-zebrafish scientists, would be helpful in communicating the value of this model organism for scientists and policy-makers considering alternate vertebrate model systems. We had started the process of drafting this review late last year, and at the Investigator's Workshop, several members of the community expressed interest in such a document for the whole community.

 <p>We would like to make this review as comprehensive as possible and don't want to miss any of the great papers that have come out in this area. If you have a publication that is out or about to be out (i.e. in press), we would love to receive the citation and/or preprint so we can include your science in this review. All materials received prior to publication release will be held in strict confidence until the appropriate paper has come out in the respective journal.

 <p>Sincerely,
Shelly Myers, Genetics, Cell Biology and Genetics - University of Minnesota
Lisa Schimmenti, MD, Pediatrics- University of Minnesota
Stephen C. Ekker, Genetics, Cell Biology and Genetics - University of Minnesota

 <p>Please send your information to:<br>

<h2><a name="antibodies">Suggest Targets for Anti-Zebrafish Antibodies</a></h2>
9 Mar 2007<br>
<div>
<p>The need for more anti-zebrafish antibodies was highlighted at the
recent conference of zebrafish investigators at Asilomar. To try and
address this, I have made some preliminary enquiries to an antibody
supplier to see if this niche market would be commercially viable. The
company that has shown some interest has expertise in making
polyclonal affinity-purified anti-peptide antibodies in goats. To make the most
of this opportunity, I need to know which antibodies would initially be
the most useful to the zebrafish community as a whole.</p>

<p>To obtain these data, please email me, <a href="mailto:gw2@sanger.ac.uk">gw2@sanger.ac.uk</a>, by Friday 6th April with a list of preferred targets identified by a GenBank or
ENSembl accession number. Preference would be given according to the
following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Popularity (number of requests for a particular antibody);
</li>
<li>
Willingness of the requestor to test a small aliquot of the
antibody and provide these data *quickly* to the company so that they can show
it works; please indicate in your reply if you'd be willing to do this.<br>
</li>
</ol>
Thanks,<br>
