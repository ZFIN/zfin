<h2>Recent Power outages at ZFIN</h2>
</center>

<p>2001/09/19:  ZFIN has been offline several times
during the past 10 days.  This been due, directly and indirectly, to several
power outages on the University of Oregon campus.

<p>There was a scheduled power outage from 2001/09/08 through 2001/09/09, 
when the University of Oregon was doing equipment testing and upgrades.
This power outage went according to plan.  However, when we tried to bring
up the ZFIN production server after the outage, the server suffered multiple
disk failures.  It took more than a day to bring up ZFIN on our backup server.
By midweek, the problems with the production server had been fixed, and ZFIN
was again, briefly down while we switched machines.

<p>The following weekend (2001/09/14) there was a large electrical storm 
(a rare thing in Eugene) that knocked out power again.  ZFIN was again
down for several hours.

<p>We are in the process of replacing our disk systems.  ZFIN may experience
brief outages in the coming weeks as we install the new drives and transfer
data to them.
