<h4 align="left"><em>(Updated 3 March 2005)</em></h4>

<p>This page contains news about the Zebrafish Information Network web site 
(<a href="/">zfin.org</a>).  This includes new features, site upgrades and scheduled down
time.  
If you have any questions or comments, please

<h2>Heat Shock Mapping Panel Updated, 2005/03/03</h2>
<p><a href="http://zfin.org/cgi-bin/webdriver?MIval=aa-crossview.apg&OID=ZDB-REFCROSS-000320-1">Heat Shock Mapping Panel Summary</a></p><br>


<h2>Entrez Gene replaces LocusLink, 2005/03/03</h2>
<p>Entrez Gene replaced LocusLink March 1, 2005.  To accomodate this change, ZFIN now provides direct connections from our gene pages to Entrez Gene records.  The LocusLink sequence information file provided at our download data site has been replaced by an Entrez Gene file (<a href="http://zfin.org/zf_info/downloads.html">http://zfin.org/zf_info/downloads.html</a>).</p><br>


<h2>Sequence analysis tools available in ZFIN, 2004/09/20</h2>
<p>A variety of sequence analysis tools are now available directly from the 
sequence information sections of ZFIN Gene, Marker and Clone pages.  The 
analysis tools available for each sequence are listed in a pull down menu in the 
far right column of the sequence information section. The tools include NCBI 
BLAST, Ensembl, Mega BLAST, SIB BLAST and the USCS BLAT genome browser.
The 'Analysis' link on these ZFIN pages provides a description of these 
different tools.</p><br>


<h2>Thisse Lab Fast Release Expression data available, 2004/09/20</h2>
<p> We are pleased to announce the premier of <a href="/<!--|CGI_BIN_DIR_NAME|-->/ZFIN_jump?record=ZDB-LAB-980204-15 " target="_top">Thisse Lab</a>  Fast Release expression data.  Fast Release expression data are single pass experiments that utilize various cDNA libraries including ZGC full-length cDNAs and I.M.A.G.E. clones as templates.  All data from these screenings are made available to the user including expression patterns that are not spatially restricted.  Expression patterns that are not spatially restricted have one image containing many embryos at a range of different developmental stages.  The probes are made using PCR as detailed in the <a href="/<!--|CGI_BIN_DIR_NAME|-->/ZFIN_jump?record=ZDB-PUB-040907-1" target="_top">methods</a>.     This data will be released at the rate of roughly 500 expression patterns a month.   To find the newest release search the <a href="/<!--|WEBDRIVER_PATH_FROM_ROOT|-->?MIval=aa-xpatselect.apg&author=thisse&xpatsel_sortByDate=1"> expression form </a>  using Thisse as the author and click the sort by release date check box.</p><br>


<h2>Online Tutorial from Madison workshop available, 2004/08/18</h2>
<p>NCBI, ZFIN and the Sanger Institute presented a joint workshop on genome 
resources at the 2004 Zebrafish Development and Genetics Meeting.  A tutorial is 
available at:  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/zebrafish/Workshop2004/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/zebrafish/Workshop2004/</a></p><br>

<h2>New Gene Product descriptions, 2004/08/17</h2>
<p>ZFIN has added gene product descriptions to the database.  The descriptions are accessed by selecting the link found in the "Gene Products" section of ZFIN gene pages.  The descriptions are derived from the comments lines found in Swiss-Prot records associated with the ZFIN genes.  Incorporation of these data is the latest enhancement of the ongoing collaboration between ZFIN and Swiss-Prot.</p><br>


<h2>ZFIN Poster, 2004 Zebrafish Development and Genetics Meeting 2004/08/05</h2>
<p>Please view ZFIN's poster from the recent zebrafish meeting at:  <a href="/zf_info/news/Madison_2004_poster.jpg">http://zfin.org/zf_info/news/Madison_2004_poster.jpg </a><br>(Image is 3.2M)</p><br>


<h2>Gene Expression Index now available   2004/07/24</h2>
<p>An index of recently published papers reporting expression can be searched using
the newly revised gene expression search form - <a href="/<!--|WEBDRIVER_PATH_FROM_ROOT|-->?MIval=aa-xpatselect.apg">http://zfin.org/cgi-bin/webdriver?MIval=aa-xpatselect.apg</a><br>
For an example of the information available, see:
<a href="/<!--|WEBDRIVER_PATH_FROM_ROOT|-->?MIval=aa-xpatindexview.apg&OID=ZDB-PUB-040220-1">http://zfin.org/cgi-bin/webdriver?MIval=aa-xpatindexview.apg&OID=ZDB-PUB-040220-1</a><br><br>

<h2>Revised Gene Expression Search Form  2004/07/24</h2>
<p>ZFIN's gene expression search form has been modified to allow easier  
and faster access to expression patterns.  You may search for expression patterns  
by gene name, mutant background, developmental stage, author, assay type and  
anatomical structures.</p><br>

<h2>Anatomical Ontology Browser   2004/07/24</h2>
<p>The anatomical ontology browser,
<a href="/<!--|WEBDRIVER_PATH_FROM_ROOT|-->?MIval=aa-anatdict.apg&mode=search">http://zfin.org/cgi-bin/webdriver?MIval=aa-anatdict.apg&mode=search</a>,
may be used to find expression patterns of interest or to find definitions of a  
particular structure.  You may use the browser to view a complete list of  
anatomical structures, to search by structure or to browse the ontology by  
developmental stage.</p>

<p>We encourage feedback on the ontology and welcome suggestions for new
structures.</p><br>
