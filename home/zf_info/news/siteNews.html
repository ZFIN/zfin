<p>This page contains news about the Zebrafish Information Network web site 
(<a href="/">zfin.org</a>).  This includes new features, site upgrades and scheduled down
time.

<h2>The Sanger Institute has released Zv6, 2006 04/05</h2>

<p>The Sanger Institute has released the sixth zebrafish genome assembly,
Zv6, on the 31st of March 2006. This assembly comprises 1.6 Gb in 6,653
scaffolds. It was generated starting with 1.02 Gb from 7,615 BAC clones
and supplemented with a 7x whole genome shotgun. The sequences were
integrated using alignments as well as BAC end and marker placement,
with particular focus on the HS and MGH panel. The assembly can be
downloaded at <a href="ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/assembly/zebrafish/Zv6release">ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/assembly/zebrafish/Zv6release</a>
and more information can be found at
<a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/Zv6_assembly_information.shtml">http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/ Zv6_assembly_information.shtml.</a>

<p>The Zv6 sequence has been used to generate an Ensembl database and a
pre-release is available at
http://pre.ensembl.org/Danio_rerio/index.html. This pre-release
features analyses including repeat masking, homology searches and ab
initio gene predictions. The full Ensembl gene set is currently in
preparation and will be released in June. </p><br> 

<h2>
Site Search Available  March 24, 2006 </h2>

<p>ZFIN Site Search provides a quick and easy glance at data available on the ZFIN web site. Simply enter your topic of interest and press the enter key.

<p>Results from Site Search and advanced ZFIN search forms may vary. Advanced ZFIN search forms query a particular class of data while Site Search searches snapshots of all ZFIN pages for an occurrence of your query string.

<p>Site Search does not take advantage of the data relationships and ontologies that are defined in the ZFIN database. For a comprehensive search of expression or anatomical structures we recommend you use the Expression or Anatomy search forms.

<p>If you do not find what you are looking for using this search, please be sure to try one of ZFIN's advanced search forms.

<h2>Probable network outage:  March 6, 2006 after 5:00PM PST </h2>
<p>A nearby fiber optic cable bundle was accidently partialy cut.
ZFIN is not currently seeing any problems but Network Services informs us 
that they will have to sever the rest of the cable latter tonight so they can finish the repair.
This will cause a ZFIN to be unreachable for a short while.</p><br>  


<h2>Brief Downtime for System Maintenance: February 27, 2006 5:00PM PST</h2> 
<p>ZFIN will briefly go down on February 27, 2006 at 5:00pm PST for system maintenance.  We expect to be up again at 5:15pm.  Thank you for your patience.</a>.</p><br>  


<h2>Online Zebrafish Genome Resources Tutorial from Dresden workshop available 2005/08/01</h2>
<p>NCBI, ZFIN and the Sanger Institute presented a joint workshop on genome resources at the 4th European Zebrafish Meeting, held in Dresden, Germany July 14 and 15, 2005. A tutorial is available at:  <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/workshop_Dresden/">http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/workshop_Dresden/</a>.</p><br>  

<h2>Figures and Morpholinos, 2005/06/30</h2>
<p>We've redesigned ZFIN's gene expression pages to display figures from  journal articles.  We've added support for morpholinos, too, so you  can find expression of your favorite genes in morphant and mutant  backgrounds.
<br>
It's still 'early days' - it takes time and effort to annotate  figures and load them into the database, and some journals still  impose copyright restrictions, but we're keeping up with new  publications and plan to gradually add figures from older papers.  <a href="/cgi-bin/webdriver?MIval=aa-xpatselect.apg">Try out the new gene expression search page.</a>
