<h1>ZFIN Site News & Status</h1>
</center>

<p>This page contains news about the Zebrafish Information Network web site 
(<a href="/">zfin.org</a>).  This includes new features, site upgrades and scheduled down
time.  
If you have any questions or comments, please 
contact <a href="mailto:zfinadmn@zfin.org">Sherry Giglia</a>.

<h2>ZFIN down for system maintenance, 2004/08/22</h2>
<p>On Sunday, August 22, ZFIN will be down from
9 am to 5 pm PDT (4 pm to 12 am GMT) for systems maintenance.</p><br>

<h2>Online Tutorial from Madison workshop available, 2004/08/18</h2>
<p>NCBI, ZFIN and the Sanger Institute presented a joint workshop on genome 
resources at the 2004 Zebrafish Development and Genetics Meeting.  A tutorial is 
available at:  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/zebrafish/Workshop2004/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/zebrafish/Workshop2004/</a></p><br>

<h2>New Gene Product descriptions, 2004/08/17</h2>
<p>ZFIN has added gene product descriptions to the database.  The descriptions are accessed by selecting the link found in the "Gene Products" section of ZFIN gene pages.  The descriptions are derived from the comments lines found in Swiss-Prot records associated with the ZFIN genes.  Incorporation of these data is the latest enhancement of the ongoing collaboration between ZFIN and Swiss-Prot.</p><br>


<h2>ZFIN Poster, 2004 Zebrafish Development and Genetics Meeting 2004/08/05</h2>

<h2>Gene Expression Index now available   2004/07/24</h2>
<p>An index of recently published papers reporting expression can be searched using
the newly revised gene expression search form - <a href="http://zfin.org/cgi-bin/webdriver?MIval=aa-xpatselect.apg">http://zfin.org/cgi-bin/webdriver?MIval=aa-xpatselect.apg</a><br>
For an example of the information available, see:
<a href="http://zfin.org/cgi-bin/webdriver?MIval=aa-xpatindexview.apg&OID=ZDB-PUB-040220-1">http://zfin.org/cgi-bin/webdriver?MIval=aa-xpatindexview.apg&OID=ZDB-PUB-040220-1</a><br><br>

<h2>Revised Gene Expression Search Form  2004/07/24</h2>
<p>ZFIN's gene expression search form has been modified to allow easier  
and faster access to expression patterns.  You may search for expression patterns  
by gene name, mutant background, developmental stage, author, assay type and  
anatomical structures.</p><br>

<h2>Anatomical Ontology Browser   2004/07/24</h2>
<p>The anatomical ontology browser,
<a href="http://zfin.org/cgi-bin/webdriver?MIval=aa-anatdict.apg&mode=search">http://zfin.org/cgi-bin/webdriver?MIval=aa-anatdict.apg&mode=search</a>,
may be used to find expression patterns of interest or to find definitions of a  
particular structure.  You may use the browser to view a complete list of  
anatomical structures, to search by structure or to browse the ontology by  
developmental stage.</p>

<p>We encourage feedback on the ontology and welcome suggestions for new
structures.</p><br>

<h2>Power outage at ZFIN, 2004/03/23</h2>
<p>On Tuesday, March 23, ZFIN was down 
from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm PST (6:00 pm to 8:00 pm GMT)
to complete wiring for our new uninterruptable power supply
(UPS).
<br><br>

<h2>Power outage at ZFIN, 2004/03/03</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, March 3, ZFIN was down 
from 10:30 am to 12:00 pm PST (6:30 pm to 8:00 pm GMT)
to do wiring for our new uninterruptable power supply
(UPS).
<br><br>

<h2>Network problems at ZFIN, 2004/02</h2>
<p>Starting on 2004/02/11 and intermittently for about 10
days after that, ZFIN experienced severe network problems.  These were due
to a number of problems, including problems with local network switches
and larger problems with the University of Oregon network.
<br><br>

<h2>Power outage at ZFIN, 2004/01/21</h2>
<p>The power was out at ZFIN for just under an hour.  This was to install
wiring to support ZFIN's new uninterruptable power supply (UPS).
