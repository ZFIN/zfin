<p><b><font size="+1">Scientific Curator</font></b><br>
ZFIN, the zebrafish model organism database, seeks scientific curators to join our dynamic, interactive team of biologists and computer scientists at the University of Oregon in Eugene, OR.
<p>
ZFIN curators acquire, analyze and index information about zebrafish gene structures, expression patterns and mutant phenotypes.  Successful candidates will be primarily responsible for the curation of zebrafish phenotype data.  Particular attention will be given to phenotypes that serve as models of human disease.  Zebrafish phenotypes and their human orthologs will be annotated using common terms and methods when possible.  Curators also participate in database, web interface and ontology design by providing biological perspectives for new content and display.
<p>
A Ph.D. in Life Sciences or M.S. with appropriate experience is required.  Applicants should have backgrounds in developmental genetics, comparative genomics or phenotype evaluation, preferably in zebrafish.
<p>
