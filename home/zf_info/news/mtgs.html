ZEBRAFISH SPECIAL SESSION

 <p>At Aquaculture 2011
 <p>
Aquaneering is pleased to announce that we will be hosting the 7th Annual Zebrafish Husbandry Workshop at the World Aquaculture Society Aquaculture 2011 conference.  The Session will take place 2:00 - 5:30pm Tuesday March 1 and 8:30 - 5:00pm Wednesday March 2, followed by an informal Town Hall Meeting Reception in the early evening.  The Session will provide useful information to Lab Managers, Technicians and others involved in Zebrafish Husbandry and other Aquatic Species and a venue for all of us to exchange ideas and experiences in an upbeat and stress-free environment.
 <p>
Please extend this invitation to anyone for whom this type of forum would be beneficial.  We would be happy to answer any questions you may have about the program.  You can also visit <a href="http://www.was.org">http://www.was.org</a> for more information about the conference (registering, exhibits etc).

 <p>
The Workshop will include talks on a broad range of subjects, including sections on:

  <p>
*Husbandry (including a section of peer submitted and ZHA reviewed and selected talks)
<br>
*Fish Disease (organized by Dr. Michael Kent/Oregon State University)
<br>

ZHA Members receive discounted registration for the Workshop! Info: <a href="mailto:nationalmeeting@zhaonline.org">nationalmeeting@zhaonline.org</a>
 <p>
(NOTE:  Some Registration forms, including the online form at WAS.org, do not list ZHA as an associate member.  Please remember to write in "ZHA" for the discounted registration rate!!!)

<div title="01-Jan-2005" >
 <h1 align="center"><a name="ensembl">Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl</a></h1>
 <h3 align="center">At your Institute - worldwide<br></h3>
 <br>
 <p>Ensembl is a joint project of the European Bioinformatics Institute and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, funded mainly by the Wellcome Trust, with additional funding from EMBL and NIH-NIAID. These courses are coordinated by Xos&#233; M Fer&#225;ndez (<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>), member of the Ensembl team involved with user queries and workshops. Throughout the year we run a number of workshops, thus have developed a quite extensive 1-day course suitable for up to 30 people with a hands-on training aspect in Ensembl that should help the attendees get the most out of the system and apply it to their own projects. We are aiming to give this course once a month, and we are considering requests for this coming year (2005).</p>

<p> Workshop:<b> "Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl"</b><br>
 We will introduce the latest developments on the website, emphasising tools for data mining. Practical exercises will assist the researcher in learning to get the best out of the data available, and some time will be allocated for participants to query the Ensembl team about issues derived from their own research. Short presentations followed by case studies.</p>

<p>Topics covered will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Overview of the Ensembl system and the latest developments (e.g. new species, outlook).</li>
  <li>Introduction to the Ensembl system</li>
  <li>Hands-on examples to introduce the system</li>
  <li>Evaluating genes and transcripts</li>
  <li>Data mining with EnsMart</li>
  <li>Comparative genomics and proteomics in Ensembl</li>
  <li>Variation (SNPs, haplotypes)</li>
  <li>Data mining is provided through EnsMart. Attendees will be introduced to several user interfaces designed to work with the system: (i) MartView - the web interface (ii) MartShell - a command-line tool, and (iii) MartExplorer - a java graphical user interface. These clients provide the user with the ability to create complex queries of data, and integrate data from BioMart datasets across the network.</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Pre-Requisites</u>: Course participants should have some biology background to understand different kinds of genomic annotation presented within Ensembl.</p>

<p>The deal is that you have to pay for travel and accommodation for someone,
but that is the only cost. For European travel this works out to be pretty
cheap (especially as we are close to Stanstead and Ryanair prices are just
silly). For US locations we would suggest both for your cost and the
sanity of the helpdesk people that two or three near-<em>ish</em> (in US terms...)
institutes organise a potential road-show.</p>


<p>The course requires an IT room of (say) 20 PC's with internet connection
and a way for one of the machines to be projected. The course lasts one
day and can be somewhat customised to the location. Usually one can have
up to 2 people per machine.</p>



<p>If people are interested in this, please contact Xos&#233; Fern&#225;ndez
(<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>) for more details and potential arrangements.
