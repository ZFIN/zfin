 <br>
 <p>
Global emergence and re-emergence of major infectious diseases is a growing and potentially gigantic world problem. A consequence of globalization is that events in one part of the world may rapidly impact on the local health status of multiple other world locations. This program bridges medical, biological, and geographical aspects of infectious disease epidemiology. This unique multidisciplinary Master course (held in English), which is given in collaboration with the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control (SMI), is designed for science/medical students with special interest in spread and control of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.

 <p>The application procedure is now open until April 15, 2009. For application documents and information material please email to: Magnus Johansson <a href="mailto:magnus.johansson@sh.se">magnus.johansson@sh.se</a>

 <br>
 <p>
The availability of complete genome sequences of an increasing number of species is having a major impact on novel biomedical approaches to human disease. Biomedical sciences and animal model system-based research will thus be of high significance for future human medicine.</p>
<p>
The international Biomedical Genomics Master course is a collaboration between the School of Life Sciences at Södertörn University and the Karolinska Institute Medical University, covering biological and medical aspects of genome sequence, gene expression and function in development, physiology and disease.</p> 
<p>	This unique biomedical Master course covers modern approaches to couple genes to diseases, and vice versa, e.g. translating genome structure and sequence into 
epigenetic regulation and gene function in cells, tissues and organs throughout animal development and in physiology. The course content is strongly based on animal model systems, e.g.<i> D. rerio, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster</i>. All courses are in English.</p>

<br></h3>
 <br>
 <p>
The US Zebrafish Community has grown from isolated labs with wildly varying husbandry protocols and little institutional regulation to hundreds of Zebrafish Labs across the country, supported by multiple organizations including the Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC), Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN) and the Zebrafish Husbandry Association (ZHA).  The move towards standardized practices continues as technicians, managers and veterinarians share information in forums such as this. Sometimes, however, it is easy to forget that we are part of an even larger whole.

 <p>Our efforts support a research community that works to solve some of society's most pressing problems, including cancer, genetic disorders, mental illness, heart disease, and environmental contamination.  This research community spans national boundaries, and as the husbandry community grows in organization and maturity, we too will establish a dialogue with those practicing zebrafish husbandry around the world.  We acknowledge that common interest and seek to promote an international dialogue in this program.

 <h1 align="center"><a name="nhgri">Zebrafish Phenome Project Workshop</a></h1>
 <h3 align="center">March 12-14, 2010, at the Doubletree Bethesda Hotel in Bethesda, Maryland<br></h3>
 <br>
 <p>
The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and the Wellcome Trust are pleased to announce the Zebrafish Phenome Project Workshop, March 12Ð14, 2010, at the Doubletree Bethesda Hotel in Bethesda, Maryland.  
                          
 <p>In March 2009 we held a small workshop at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. The point of this meeting was to assess the feasibility of systematically mutating every protein-coding gene in the zebrafish genome and then phenotypically characterizing each mutation. The consensus that emerged from the meeting was that current mutagenesis technologies were capable of mutating the majority of zebrafish genes, and high-quality phenotyping of the mutations would be a difficult but achievable goal given certain advances in high-throughput characterization. The timeline for such a project would be on the order of 10 years.

 <p>The next logical step was to open the discussion of the value of this project to the entire zebrafish community. Thus a second meeting in Bethesda will have two purposes: 1) to review for all attendees the major points discussed in Hinxton (adding new information from other researchers), and 2) to determine if there is strong support to proceed with a ÒZebrafish Phenome ProjectÓ and if so, to generate a concrete plan of action with a defined set of priorities.

 <p>Registration is now open and you may begin reserving your hotel rooms (room reservations are the responsibility of the attendees). Please click on the linkfor additional information and to register online:

 <p><a href="http://www.blsmeetings.net/zebrafish/">http://www.blsmeetings.net/zebrafish/</a>

 <p> Please note: The Workshop is scheduled to begin at approximately 1:30 p.m. on Friday, March 12, and end at approximately 2:00 p.m. on Sunday, March 14.

 <p>A more detailed agenda and additional logistical information will be sent to registrants closer to the event.

 <p>Methods in ZebraFish Behavior analysis is the premier meeting for scientists willing to analyze zebrafish's behavioral or physiological data by mean of imaging techniques.
This year we will also promote networking among European University and Industries willing to deploy ZebraFish in their facilities.

 <p>High throughput ZebraFish studies involves an increasing number of labs around the world.
But when setting up an experimental protocol, a number of challenges arise.
Based on successful "user case" experience, the meeting presentations will highlight the key steps to design and analyze your experiment.

<blockquote>
 <br>The presentations will be focused on the technical aspects of behavior analysis.
 <br>New technologies in ZebraFish Behavior analysis will be demonstrated.
 <br>The round tables will let us debate on the needs of the zebrafish community.

 <h1 align="center"><a name="ensembl">Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl</a></h1>
 <h3 align="center">At your Institute - worldwide<br></h3>
 <br>
 <p>Ensembl is a joint project of the European Bioinformatics Institute and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, funded mainly by the Wellcome Trust, with additional funding from EMBL and NIH-NIAID. These courses are coordinated by Xos&#233; M Fer&#225;ndez (<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>), member of the Ensembl team involved with user queries and workshops. Throughout the year we run a number of workshops, thus have developed a quite extensive 1-day course suitable for up to 30 people with a hands-on training aspect in Ensembl that should help the attendees get the most out of the system and apply it to their own projects. We are aiming to give this course once a month, and we are considering requests for this coming year (2005).</p>

<p> Workshop:<b> "Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl"</b><br>
 We will introduce the latest developments on the website, emphasising tools for data mining. Practical exercises will assist the researcher in learning to get the best out of the data available, and some time will be allocated for participants to query the Ensembl team about issues derived from their own research. Short presentations followed by case studies.</p>

<p>Topics covered will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Overview of the Ensembl system and the latest developments (e.g. new species, outlook).</li>
  <li>Introduction to the Ensembl system</li>
  <li>Hands-on examples to introduce the system</li>
  <li>Evaluating genes and transcripts</li>
  <li>Data mining with EnsMart</li>
  <li>Comparative genomics and proteomics in Ensembl</li>
  <li>Variation (SNPs, haplotypes)</li>
  <li>Data mining is provided through EnsMart. Attendees will be introduced to several user interfaces designed to work with the system: (i) MartView - the web interface (ii) MartShell - a command-line tool, and (iii) MartExplorer - a java graphical user interface. These clients provide the user with the ability to create complex queries of data, and integrate data from BioMart datasets across the network.</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Pre-Requisites</u>: Course participants should have some biology background to understand different kinds of genomic annotation presented within Ensembl.</p>

<p>The deal is that you have to pay for travel and accommodation for someone,
but that is the only cost. For European travel this works out to be pretty
cheap (especially as we are close to Stanstead and Ryanair prices are just
silly). For US locations we would suggest both for your cost and the
sanity of the helpdesk people that two or three near-<em>ish</em> (in US terms...)
institutes organise a potential road-show.</p>


<p>The course requires an IT room of (say) 20 PC's with internet connection
and a way for one of the machines to be projected. The course lasts one
day and can be somewhat customised to the location. Usually one can have
up to 2 people per machine.</p>



<p>If people are interested in this, please contact Xos&#233; Fern&#225;ndez
(<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>) for more details and potential arrangements.
