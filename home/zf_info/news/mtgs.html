 <br>
 <p>
	Every winter term starting in October the Biotechnology Center (BIOTEC) of Technische Universitat Dresden, Germany, offers the two-year international Master's programme "Molecular Bioengineering". It is taught completely in English. Applicants must hold a Bachelor's or an equivalent qualification in Biology / Life Sciences, Biotechnology, Chemistry / Biochemistry, Computer science, Materials science, Medicine, Nanotechnology or Physics.
 </p>
<p>
	The application procedure is now open, application deadline is 15 June 2008. The application forms and further information material can be found on the following website: <a href="http://www.biotec.tu-dresden.de/teaching">http://www.biotec.tu-dresden.de/teaching</a>.

 <br>
 <p>
	(Travel Awards are available for graduate students)
</p>
<p>
	This workshop will be held on June 22nd 2008 as a special event of the 6th International Symposium on Fish Endocrinology (6ISFE) in Calgary, Alberta, Canada (June 22-27, 2008). The workshop is free and open to everyone who is registered with the main conference. February 15 is the deadline for early bird registration and abstract submission (<a href="http://www.isfe.ucalgary.ca/">http://www.isfe.ucalgary.ca/</a>).
</p>
<p>
	The organizers of the workshop have invited 12 experts to speak at the workshop, and their talks will focus on the functions and molecular mechanisms of hormones and their receptors using zebrafish as the model. The goals of this workshop are to promote the exchange of information and international collaborations between developmental biologists and comparative endocrinologists, inform investigators about the genomic and molecular tools available in the zebrafish model, and ultimately facilitate the growth of the field of "developmental endocrinology". Scientists of different nationalities, genders, and career stages will participate in the workshop. It is anticipated that this workshop will not only advance discoveries in basic sciences, but also help develop applications in related fields such as biotechnology and aquaculture.
</p>
<p>At the workshop, travel awards will be given to selected graduate students. Students from under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply.

 <br>
 <p>Applications are being accepted for this 1-week short course for individuals with maintenance, management or research responsibilities in which fish are used as laboratory animals.

<p>APPLICATION DEADLINE - JULY 15.

<p>The course is offered at the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, Salisbury Cove, Maine during the period of 25 - 29 August 2008.  Topics to be discussed will include  general system design and water quality management, anatomy and histology of fish, general fish diseases and disease management strategies.  Infectious and non-infectious diseases common to all fish as well as specific diseases of importance to laboratory-maintained zebrafish will be discussed.  The course will consist of lecture, laboratory exercises and discussions. During the course there will be an opportunity for students to discuss unusual and/or unsolved diagnostic case experiences from their home laboratories as problem-solving exercises.  The course should be particularly valuable to technical staff, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, junior faculty and investigators needing skills to monitor the health of a colony of aquatic organisms.

 <p>State of the art imaging is crucial for most of today's biomedical research. Advances in imaging technology enables us to produce excellent image data sets, yet the development of adequate data mining tools is lagging far behind.

 <p>This symposium sets out to initiate a platform for knowledge exchange in the field of image data extraction and image mining.

 <h1 align="center"><a name="ensembl">Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl</a></h1>
 <h3 align="center">At your Institute - worldwide<br></h3>
 <br>
 <p>Ensembl is a joint project of the European Bioinformatics Institute and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, funded mainly by the Wellcome Trust, with additional funding from EMBL and NIH-NIAID. These courses are coordinated by Xos&#233; M Fer&#225;ndez (<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>), member of the Ensembl team involved with user queries and workshops. Throughout the year we run a number of workshops, thus have developed a quite extensive 1-day course suitable for up to 30 people with a hands-on training aspect in Ensembl that should help the attendees get the most out of the system and apply it to their own projects. We are aiming to give this course once a month, and we are considering requests for this coming year (2005).</p>

<p> Workshop:<b> "Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl"</b><br>
 We will introduce the latest developments on the website, emphasising tools for data mining. Practical exercises will assist the researcher in learning to get the best out of the data available, and some time will be allocated for participants to query the Ensembl team about issues derived from their own research. Short presentations followed by case studies.</p>

<p>Topics covered will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Overview of the Ensembl system and the latest developments (e.g. new species, outlook).</li>
  <li>Introduction to the Ensembl system</li>
  <li>Hands-on examples to introduce the system</li>
  <li>Evaluating genes and transcripts</li>
  <li>Data mining with EnsMart</li>
  <li>Comparative genomics and proteomics in Ensembl</li>
  <li>Variation (SNPs, haplotypes)</li>
  <li>Data mining is provided through EnsMart. Attendees will be introduced to several user interfaces designed to work with the system: (i) MartView - the web interface (ii) MartShell - a command-line tool, and (iii) MartExplorer - a java graphical user interface. These clients provide the user with the ability to create complex queries of data, and integrate data from BioMart datasets across the network.</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Pre-Requisites</u>: Course participants should have some biology background to understand different kinds of genomic annotation presented within Ensembl.</p>

<p>The deal is that you have to pay for travel and accommodation for someone,
but that is the only cost. For European travel this works out to be pretty
cheap (especially as we are close to Stanstead and Ryanair prices are just
silly). For US locations we would suggest both for your cost and the
sanity of the helpdesk people that two or three near-<em>ish</em> (in US terms...)
institutes organise a potential road-show.</p>


<p>The course requires an IT room of (say) 20 PC's with internet connection
and a way for one of the machines to be projected. The course lasts one
day and can be somewhat customised to the location. Usually one can have
up to 2 people per machine.</p>



<p>If people are interested in this, please contact Xos&#233; Fern&#225;ndez
(<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>) for more details and potential arrangements.
