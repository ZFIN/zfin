 <h1 align="center"><a name="ensembl">Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl</a></h1>

<h3 align="center">At your Institute - worldwide<br></h3>


<p>Ensembl is a joint project of the European Bioinformatics Institute and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, funded mainly by the Wellcome Trust, with additional funding from EMBL and NIH-NIAID. These courses are coordinated by Xos&#233 M Fer&#225ndez (<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>), member of the Ensembl team involved with user queries and workshops. Throughout the year we run a number of workshops, thus have developed a quite extensive 1-day course suitable for up to 30 people with a hands-on training aspect in Ensembl that should help the attendees get the most out of the system and apply it to their own projects. We are aiming to give this course once a month, and we are considering requests for this coming year (2005).</p>

<p> Workshop:<b> "Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl"</b><br>
 We will introduce the latest developments on the website, emphasising tools for data mining. Practical exercises will assist the researcher in learning to get the best out of the data available, and some time will be allocated for participants to query the Ensembl team about issues derived from their own research. Short presentations followed by case studies.</p>

<p>Topics covered will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Overview of the Ensembl system and the latest developments (e.g. new species, outlook).</li>
  <li>Introduction to the Ensembl system</li>
  <li>Hands-on examples to introduce the system</li>
  <li>Evaluating genes and transcripts</li>
  <li>Data mining with EnsMart</li>
  <li>Comparative genomics and proteomics in Ensembl</li>
  <li>Variation (SNPs, haplotypes)</li>
  <li>Data mining is provided through EnsMart. Attendees will be introduced to several user interfaces designed to work with the system: (i) MartView - the web interface (ii) MartShell - a command-line tool, and (iii) MartExplorer - a java graphical user interface. These clients provide the user with the ability to create complex queries of data, and integrate data from BioMart datasets across the network.</li></p></ul>

<p><u>Pre-Requisites</u>: Course participants should have some biology background to understand different kinds of genomic annotation presented within Ensembl.</p>

<p>The deal is that you have to pay for travel and accommodation for someone,
but that is the only cost. For European travel this works out to be pretty
cheap (especially as we are close to Stanstead and Ryanair prices are just
silly). For US locations we would suggest both for your cost and the
sanity of the helpdesk people that two or three near-<em>ish</em> (in US terms...)
institutes organise a potential road-show.</p>


<p>The course requires an IT room of (say) 20 PC's with internet connection
and a way for one of the machines to be projected. The course lasts one
day and can be somewhat customised to the location. Usually one can have
up to 2 people per machine.</p>



<p>If people are interested in this, please contact Xos&#233
Fern&#225ndez (<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>) for more details and potential arrangements.

 <br>A Special Topics Course at the 
Marine Biological Laboratory

</p>



<p>Directors: 			
<br>Mary Mullins, University of Pennsylvania
<br>Chi-Bin Chien, University of Utah


<p>Financial assistance is available.

<p>This is an intensive two-week lecture-laboratory course taught by leaders in the field for advanced graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and independent investigators that will focus on the development and genetics of zebrafish with special emphasis on the nervous system.  

<p>Students will learn methods for manipulating and studying gene function, including mutant screening, mapping and cloning; transgenesis and antisense approaches; mosaic analysis; and in situ methods for detecting gene expression. In addition students will be introduced to the nervous system of zebrafish, its organization and development, and methods for the analysis of nervous system mutants including visualizing single neurons in live embryos, labeling and analyzing axon projections, and performing behavioral tests on live animals.

<p>Partial funding for this course is provided by the National Institutes of Health and the Grass Foundation.

<p>Application Deadline: April 6, 2007

<h1 align="center"><a name="jan">Health and Colony Management of Laboratory Fish</a></h1>

<h3 align="center">September 17 - 22, 2007 - Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, Salisbury Cove, Maine <br></h3>


</p>



<p> This course is a 1-week educational opportunity for
individuals with maintenance, management or research responsibilities in
which fish are used as laboratory animals. The course is offered at the
Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, Salisbury Cove, Maine during
the period of 17 - 22 September 2007.  Topics to be discussed will
include general system design and water quality management, anatomy and
histology of fish, general fish diseases and disease management strategies.
Infectious and non-infectious diseases common to all fish as well as
specific diseases of importance to laboratory-maintained zebrafish will
be discussed.  

<p>The course will consist of lecture, laboratory exercises and
discussions. During the course there will be an opportunity for students
to discuss unusual and/or unsolved diagnostic case experiences from
their home laboratories as problem-solving exercises. The course should be
particularly valuable to technical staff, graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows, junior faculty and investigators needing skills to monitor the
health of a colony of aquatic organisms.

course, please see the course web site at:

<h3 align="center">January 5-8, 2008 in San Diego, CA<br></h3>


</p>



<p>All organisms, including humans, are built from the same basic set of genes, yet most of us are able to follow work on just a few species. It is more important than ever for investigators working on different organisms, including humans, to communicate with each other and exchange ideas. The GSA is taking the lead in promoting this kind of interaction with this meeting that will highlight research on diverse systems that inform human biology.

<p>There will be sessions on:

<blockquote>

      <br>prokaryotes and pathogens
     <br>chromosomes, chromatin

        <br>RNA-mediated regulation

        <br>new technology for metazoan analysis

        <br>stem cells and cancer

        <br>populations and evolution

        <br>neurobiology and behavior

        <br>aging, and engineering 
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Registration and abstract submission sites open online in September 2007
