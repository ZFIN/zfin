 <h1 align="center"><a name="ensembl">Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl</a></h1>

<h3 align="center">At your Institute - worldwide<br></h3>


<p>Ensembl is a joint project of the European Bioinformatics Institute and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, funded mainly by the Wellcome Trust, with additional funding from EMBL and NIH-NIAID. These courses are coordinated by Xos&#233 M Fer&#225ndez (<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>), member of the Ensembl team involved with user queries and workshops. Throughout the year we run a number of workshops, thus have developed a quite extensive 1-day course suitable for up to 30 people with a hands-on training aspect in Ensembl that should help the attendees get the most out of the system and apply it to their own projects. We are aiming to give this course once a month, and we are considering requests for this coming year (2005).</p>

<p> Workshop:<b> "Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl"</b><br>
 We will introduce the latest developments on the website, emphasising tools for data mining. Practical exercises will assist the researcher in learning to get the best out of the data available, and some time will be allocated for participants to query the Ensembl team about issues derived from their own research. Short presentations followed by case studies.</p>

<p>Topics covered will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Overview of the Ensembl system and the latest developments (e.g. new species, outlook).</li>
  <li>Introduction to the Ensembl system</li>
  <li>Hands-on examples to introduce the system</li>
  <li>Evaluating genes and transcripts</li>
  <li>Data mining with EnsMart</li>
  <li>Comparative genomics and proteomics in Ensembl</li>
  <li>Variation (SNPs, haplotypes)</li>
  <li>Data mining is provided through EnsMart. Attendees will be introduced to several user interfaces designed to work with the system: (i) MartView - the web interface (ii) MartShell - a command-line tool, and (iii) MartExplorer - a java graphical user interface. These clients provide the user with the ability to create complex queries of data, and integrate data from BioMart datasets across the network.</li></p></ul>

<p><u>Pre-Requisites</u>: Course participants should have some biology background to understand different kinds of genomic annotation presented within Ensembl.</p>

<p>The deal is that you have to pay for travel and accommodation for someone,
but that is the only cost. For European travel this works out to be pretty
cheap (especially as we are close to Stanstead and Ryanair prices are just
silly). For US locations we would suggest both for your cost and the
sanity of the helpdesk people that two or three near-<em>ish</em> (in US terms...)
institutes organise a potential road-show.</p>


<p>The course requires an IT room of (say) 20 PC's with internet connection
and a way for one of the machines to be projected. The course lasts one
day and can be somewhat customised to the location. Usually one can have
up to 2 people per machine.</p>



<p>If people are interested in this, please contact Xos&#233
Fern&#225ndez (<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>) for more details and potential arrangements.

 <h1 align="center"><a name="calcium">Discussion Meeting: Calcium Signals and Developmental Patterning</a></h1>

<h3 align="center">February 19-20, 2007 - The Royal Society, 6-9 Carlton House Terrace, London, SW1Y 5AG, UK<br></h3>

<p>Synopsis:

<p>Calcium signalling pathways are found to be central to the evolution of the embryonic axes. These discoveries complement work in which the molecular determinants of pattern have been elucidated.  This meeting aims to transfer knowledge between the fields of calcium signalling and molecular embryology and to begin to build an integrated approach to the study of calcium signalling in later development.

 <h1 align="center"><a name="aquaneering">Zebrafish Special Session at Aquaculture 2007</a></h1>

<h3 align="center">February 28, 2007, San Antonio (Texas)<br></h3>


</p>



<p>Happy New Year!  Aquaneering proudly announces that we will again be hosting a Special Session on Zebrafish at the Aquaculture 2007 conference.  The Zebrafish Session will take place on Wednesday February 28 with talks scheduled throughout the day and an informal Town Hall Meeting Reception in the early evening.
The Session will provide useful information to Lab Managers and others involved in Zebrafish Husbandry and a venue for all of us to exchange ideas and experiences in an upbeat and stress-free environment.

<p>Please extend this invitation to anyone for whom this type of forum would be beneficial.  We would be happy to answer any questions you may have about the program.  You can also visit <a href="http://www.was.org">http://www.was.org</a> for more information about the conference, registering, exhibits etc.

<p>We hope to see you in San Antonio!

 <h1 align="center"><a name="minerve">From Sensory Perception to Motor Output: Genetic Bases of Behaviour in the Zebrafish Embryo</a></h1>

<h3 align="center">March 15-18, 2007 - Minerve, South of France<br></h3>
<p>
A small-scale, three days workshop "from sensory perception to motor output: genetic bases of behaviour in the zebrafish embryo" will take place in Minerve, South of France, on March 15-18, 2007. 
</p>
<p>
The emphasis of the workshop will be on the development of the various sensory systems as well as on their integration at higher levels up to the motor output. A major aim of the meeting, besides the exchange of ideas and information, will be to promote interactions between the groups that are currently working on this question.
</p>
<p> 
Besides the 25 invited speakers, there will be room for 12 additional attendants, graduate students or post-docs. They will have the opportunity to give a short talk or present a poster.
</p>
<p>
Expenses: registration will amount to 200 Euro covering everything from Montpellier, March 15th 5PM to Montpellier, March 18th 5PM. We cannot cover travel expenses. 
</p>
<p> 
If you are interested in attending this workshop, please send us before January 22 a short description of your research interests and/or the reasons why you would like to participate at neurogen@univ-montp2.fr. Responses will be given by January 25.
</p>
