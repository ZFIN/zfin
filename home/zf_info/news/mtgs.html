 <h1 align="center"><a name="ensembl">Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl</a></h1>

<h3 align="center">At your Institute - worldwide<br></h3>


<p>Ensembl is a joint project of the European Bioinformatics Institute and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, funded mainly by the Wellcome Trust, with additional funding from EMBL and NIH-NIAID. These courses are coordinated by Xos&#233 M Fer&#225ndez (<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>), member of the Ensembl team involved with user queries and workshops. Throughout the year we run a number of workshops, thus have developed a quite extensive 1-day course suitable for up to 30 people with a hands-on training aspect in Ensembl that should help the attendees get the most out of the system and apply it to their own projects. We are aiming to give this course once a month, and we are considering requests for this coming year (2005).</p>

<p> Workshop:<b> "Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl"</b><br>
 We will introduce the latest developments on the website, emphasising tools for data mining. Practical exercises will assist the researcher in learning to get the best out of the data available, and some time will be allocated for participants to query the Ensembl team about issues derived from their own research. Short presentations followed by case studies.</p>

<p>Topics covered will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Overview of the Ensembl system and the latest developments (e.g. new species, outlook).</li>
  <li>Introduction to the Ensembl system</li>
  <li>Hands-on examples to introduce the system</li>
  <li>Evaluating genes and transcripts</li>
  <li>Data mining with EnsMart</li>
  <li>Comparative genomics and proteomics in Ensembl</li>
  <li>Variation (SNPs, haplotypes)</li>
  <li>Data mining is provided through EnsMart. Attendees will be introduced to several user interfaces designed to work with the system: (i) MartView - the web interface (ii) MartShell - a command-line tool, and (iii) MartExplorer - a java graphical user interface. These clients provide the user with the ability to create complex queries of data, and integrate data from BioMart datasets across the network.</li></p></ul>

<p><u>Pre-Requisites</u>: Course participants should have some biology background to understand different kinds of genomic annotation presented within Ensembl.</p>

<p>The deal is that you have to pay for travel and accommodation for someone,
but that is the only cost. For European travel this works out to be pretty
cheap (especially as we are close to Stanstead and Ryanair prices are just
silly). For US locations we would suggest both for your cost and the
sanity of the helpdesk people that two or three near-<em>ish</em> (in US terms...)
institutes organise a potential road-show.</p>


<p>The course requires an IT room of (say) 20 PC's with internet connection
and a way for one of the machines to be projected. The course lasts one
day and can be somewhat customised to the location. Usually one can have
up to 2 people per machine.</p>



<p>If people are interested in this, please contact Xos&#233
Fern&#225ndez (<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>) for more details and potential arrangements.

<p>
The Canadian Zebrafish Workshop will be held from 9am - 5pm on Thursday February 28th and is organized by Sarah Childs and Andrew Waskiewicz. This meeting will be held just before the Canadian Developmental Biology Meeting (which is held from the evening of Feb 28th through Mar 2nd). We invite all researchers working with the zebrafish (or other fish) model system to join us for the day.

<p>We will invite one short talk from a trainee or PI from each lab to highlight the research in their lab. In a preliminary survey we had interest from 20 different labs!
We will also have time for group discussions on technology or Canadian Zebrafish Initiatives, and the topics will be taken from people's suggestions.

<p>I)  We won't know you're coming unless you register. Please contact Sarah Childs (<a href=mailto:schilds@ucalgary.ca>schilds@ucalgary.ca</a>).

2nd  Developmental Genetics of Zebrafish and Medaka II</a></h1>

<h3 align="center">March 3-12, 2008 - National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan<br></h3>


</p>

<p>NIBB International Practical Course<br>
2nd  Developmental Genetics of Zebrafish and Medaka II 

<p>Date: March 3rd -12th 2008 

<p>Location: National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan

<p>Language: English  

<p>Zebrafish and medaka are excellent vertebrate models for genetic study.
Thanks to transgenic technique and embryonic manipulation, these animals are
also useful for precise analysis of many events during vertebrate
development. The course will cover basic technologies, including gene
knockdown by injecting anitisense morpholino-oligo, as well as a number of
advanced techniques such as BAC homologous recombination mediated
transgenesis, genomic/bioinformatic techniques, and cell tracking using
photoconvertible fluorescent proteins. A guest lecturer will discuss
emerging topics in the zebrafish and medaka fields. Informal interaction
between students and course faculty is encouraged.

<p>This is the second international practical course supported by the National
Institute for Basic Biology (NIBB) in Japan and is mainly designed for young
scientists and those wanting to study in a new field. Travel and
accommodation support is available to participants from all countries.

<p>Application deadline is November 30th, 2007.

<h3 align="center">August 25 - 29, 2008 - Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, Salisbury Cove, Maine<br></h3>


</p>



<p>Applications are being accepted for this 1-week short course for individuals with maintenance, management or research responsibilities in which fish are used as laboratory animals.

<p>APPLICATION DEADLINE - JULY 15.

<p>The course is offered at the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, Salisbury Cove, Maine during the period of 25 - 29 August 2008.  Topics to be discussed will include  general system design and water quality management, anatomy and histology of fish, general fish diseases and disease management strategies.  Infectious and non-infectious diseases common to all fish as well as specific diseases of importance to laboratory-maintained zebrafish will be discussed.  The course will consist of lecture, laboratory exercises and discussions. During the course there will be an opportunity for students to discuss unusual and/or unsolved diagnostic case experiences from their home laboratories as problem-solving exercises.  The course should be particularly valuable to technical staff, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, junior faculty and investigators needing skills to monitor the health of a colony of aquatic organisms.
