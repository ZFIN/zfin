 <br>
 <p>The Third Strategic Conference of Zebrafish Investigators will be held from January 24 - 28, 2009 at Asilomar, California, USA. This exciting meeting is open to principal investigators from all countries working with zebrafish and medaka. The goals are to discuss current developments and to promote coordinated advancement of research employing fish as a model system. Reserve the date and check <a href="http://www.ciwemb.edu/sites/SCZI2009/">http://www.ciwemb.edu/sites/SCZI2009/</a> for more details and registration information.

 <br>
 <p>On behalf of the Adelaide Organising Committee, and our Major Sponsors ZebTec, NGED and the CMGD, it is with great pleasure that I invite you to register for the 10th Australia and New Zealand Zebrafish Workshop, hosted by the University of Adelaide Zebrafish Community, to be held at the Whalers Inn Resort, Victor Harbour, South Australia from the 2nd to the 4th of February, 2009.  This meeting will be followed by a one day Zebrafish Husbandry Workshop to be held back at the University of Adelaide on the 5th of February, 2009.

 <p>Registrations are now open, and will be accepted up until the 10th of October 2008.  While registrations may be accepted beyond this date, please be aware that they will incur a late fee of $100 on top of the standard registration fee.

 <h3 align="center">15-19 July 2009 - Rome, Italy<br></h3>
 <br>
 <p>
The 6th European Zebrafish Genetics and Development Meeting 
will be held on July 15 - 19, 2009 in  Rome - Italy.
This meeting will cover all aspects of the biology of zebrafish, medaka and other teleost models. The meeting will feature a variety of oral sessions, posters, workshops, and exhibitor stands, focusing on the use of model teleosts in scientific research.
Please join us for an extraordinary conference that will reflect the broad interest of our research and the increasing scientific impact of our field. Registration, information and preliminary program will be available soon at <a href="http://www.zebrafish2009.org">http://www.zebrafish2009.org</a>

 <h1 align="center"><a name="ensembl">Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl</a></h1>
 <h3 align="center">At your Institute - worldwide<br></h3>
 <br>
 <p>Ensembl is a joint project of the European Bioinformatics Institute and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, funded mainly by the Wellcome Trust, with additional funding from EMBL and NIH-NIAID. These courses are coordinated by Xos&#233; M Fer&#225;ndez (<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>), member of the Ensembl team involved with user queries and workshops. Throughout the year we run a number of workshops, thus have developed a quite extensive 1-day course suitable for up to 30 people with a hands-on training aspect in Ensembl that should help the attendees get the most out of the system and apply it to their own projects. We are aiming to give this course once a month, and we are considering requests for this coming year (2005).</p>

<p> Workshop:<b> "Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl"</b><br>
 We will introduce the latest developments on the website, emphasising tools for data mining. Practical exercises will assist the researcher in learning to get the best out of the data available, and some time will be allocated for participants to query the Ensembl team about issues derived from their own research. Short presentations followed by case studies.</p>

<p>Topics covered will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Overview of the Ensembl system and the latest developments (e.g. new species, outlook).</li>
  <li>Introduction to the Ensembl system</li>
  <li>Hands-on examples to introduce the system</li>
  <li>Evaluating genes and transcripts</li>
  <li>Data mining with EnsMart</li>
  <li>Comparative genomics and proteomics in Ensembl</li>
  <li>Variation (SNPs, haplotypes)</li>
  <li>Data mining is provided through EnsMart. Attendees will be introduced to several user interfaces designed to work with the system: (i) MartView - the web interface (ii) MartShell - a command-line tool, and (iii) MartExplorer - a java graphical user interface. These clients provide the user with the ability to create complex queries of data, and integrate data from BioMart datasets across the network.</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Pre-Requisites</u>: Course participants should have some biology background to understand different kinds of genomic annotation presented within Ensembl.</p>

<p>The deal is that you have to pay for travel and accommodation for someone,
but that is the only cost. For European travel this works out to be pretty
cheap (especially as we are close to Stanstead and Ryanair prices are just
silly). For US locations we would suggest both for your cost and the
sanity of the helpdesk people that two or three near-<em>ish</em> (in US terms...)
institutes organise a potential road-show.</p>


<p>The course requires an IT room of (say) 20 PC's with internet connection
and a way for one of the machines to be projected. The course lasts one
day and can be somewhat customised to the location. Usually one can have
up to 2 people per machine.</p>



<p>If people are interested in this, please contact Xos&#233; Fern&#225;ndez
(<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>) for more details and potential arrangements.
