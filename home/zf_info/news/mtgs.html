 <h1 align="center"><a name="soder">One -year Master Program in Infectious Disease Control</a></h1>
 <h3 align="center">Starting in August 2009 at Sodertorn University, Stockholm (Huddinge), Sweden<br></h3>
 <br>
 <p>
Global emergence and re-emergence of major infectious diseases is a growing and potentially gigantic world problem. A consequence of globalization is that events in one part of the world may rapidly impact on the local health status of multiple other world locations. This program bridges medical, biological, and geographical aspects of infectious disease epidemiology. This unique multidisciplinary Master course (held in English), which is given in collaboration with the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control (SMI), is designed for science/medical students with special interest in spread and control of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.

 <p>The application procedure is now open until April 15, 2009. For application documents and information material please email to: Magnus Johansson <a href="mailto:magnus.johansson@sh.se">magnus.johansson@sh.se</a>

 <br>
 <p>
The availability of complete genome sequences of an increasing number of species is having a major impact on novel biomedical approaches to human disease. Biomedical sciences and animal model system-based research will thus be of high significance for future human medicine.</p>
<p>
The international Biomedical Genomics Master course is a collaboration between the School of Life Sciences at Sodertorn University and the Karolinska Institute Medical University, covering biological and medical aspects of genome sequence, gene expression and function in development, physiology and disease.</p> 
<p>	This unique biomedical Master course covers modern approaches to couple genes to diseases, and vice versa, e.g. translating genome structure and sequence into 
epigenetic regulation and gene function in cells, tissues and organs throughout animal development and in physiology. The course content is strongly based on animal model systems, e.g.<i> D. rerio, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster</i>. All courses are in English.</p>
<p>
Applications are accepted now, until April 15, 2009. Applications after April 15 are accepted on a space availability basis. For application documents and information material please email to: Per Kylsten  <a href="mailto:per.kylsten@sh.se">per.kylsten@sh.se</a>

 <p>
The 2011 Australia and New Zealand Meeting will be held on the 6-9 February at Tangalooma Island Resort. Conference activites will start with registration and welcoming drinks at 6:30 PM on Sunday, the 6th of February. The scientific program will run the full day on the 7th and 8th of February, followed by the conference dinner on the 8th.
 <p>
Tangalooma Island Resort is located on Moreton Island, the third largest sand island in the world. The ferry to get to Tangalooma leaves from Holt St, in Pinkenba, QLD. It takes approximately 10 mintutes to travel to the ferry terminal from Brisbane Airport. The ferry to Tangalooma leaves at 5 pm on the 6th of February. Guests are asked to arrive at the ferry terminal 45 mintues prior to departure. Delegates will be able to leave on the early ferry on the 9th of February, arriving back on the mainland at 10:15 AM on the 9th of February.
 <p>
In order to co-ordinate with the ferry schedule, delegates arriving from out of town should plan to arrive in Brisbane before 4:00 PM on the 6th of February, and plan to depart after 10:30 AM on the 9th.

<div title="01-Jan-2005" >
 <h1 align="center"><a name="ensembl">Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl</a></h1>
 <h3 align="center">At your Institute - worldwide<br></h3>
 <br>
 <p>Ensembl is a joint project of the European Bioinformatics Institute and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, funded mainly by the Wellcome Trust, with additional funding from EMBL and NIH-NIAID. These courses are coordinated by Xos&#233; M Fer&#225;ndez (<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>), member of the Ensembl team involved with user queries and workshops. Throughout the year we run a number of workshops, thus have developed a quite extensive 1-day course suitable for up to 30 people with a hands-on training aspect in Ensembl that should help the attendees get the most out of the system and apply it to their own projects. We are aiming to give this course once a month, and we are considering requests for this coming year (2005).</p>

<p> Workshop:<b> "Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl"</b><br>
 We will introduce the latest developments on the website, emphasising tools for data mining. Practical exercises will assist the researcher in learning to get the best out of the data available, and some time will be allocated for participants to query the Ensembl team about issues derived from their own research. Short presentations followed by case studies.</p>

<p>Topics covered will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Overview of the Ensembl system and the latest developments (e.g. new species, outlook).</li>
  <li>Introduction to the Ensembl system</li>
  <li>Hands-on examples to introduce the system</li>
  <li>Evaluating genes and transcripts</li>
  <li>Data mining with EnsMart</li>
  <li>Comparative genomics and proteomics in Ensembl</li>
  <li>Variation (SNPs, haplotypes)</li>
  <li>Data mining is provided through EnsMart. Attendees will be introduced to several user interfaces designed to work with the system: (i) MartView - the web interface (ii) MartShell - a command-line tool, and (iii) MartExplorer - a java graphical user interface. These clients provide the user with the ability to create complex queries of data, and integrate data from BioMart datasets across the network.</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Pre-Requisites</u>: Course participants should have some biology background to understand different kinds of genomic annotation presented within Ensembl.</p>

<p>The deal is that you have to pay for travel and accommodation for someone,
but that is the only cost. For European travel this works out to be pretty
cheap (especially as we are close to Stanstead and Ryanair prices are just
silly). For US locations we would suggest both for your cost and the
sanity of the helpdesk people that two or three near-<em>ish</em> (in US terms...)
institutes organise a potential road-show.</p>


<p>The course requires an IT room of (say) 20 PC's with internet connection
and a way for one of the machines to be projected. The course lasts one
day and can be somewhat customised to the location. Usually one can have
up to 2 people per machine.</p>



<p>If people are interested in this, please contact Xos&#233; Fern&#225;ndez
(<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>) for more details and potential arrangements.
