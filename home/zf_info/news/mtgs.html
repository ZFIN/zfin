 <h1 align="center"><a name="ensembl">Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl</a></h1>

<h3 align="center">At your Institute - worldwide<br></h3>


<p>Ensembl is a joint project of the European Bioinformatics Institute and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, funded mainly by the Wellcome Trust, with additional funding from EMBL and NIH-NIAID. These courses are coordinated by Xos&#233 M Fer&#225ndez (<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>), member of the Ensembl team involved with user queries and workshops. Throughout the year we run a number of workshops, thus have developed a quite extensive 1-day course suitable for up to 30 people with a hands-on training aspect in Ensembl that should help the attendees get the most out of the system and apply it to their own projects. We are aiming to give this course once a month, and we are considering requests for this coming year (2005).</p>

<p> Workshop:<b> "Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl"</b><br>
 We will introduce the latest developments on the website, emphasising tools for data mining. Practical exercises will assist the researcher in learning to get the best out of the data available, and some time will be allocated for participants to query the Ensembl team about issues derived from their own research. Short presentations followed by case studies.</p>

<p>Topics covered will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Overview of the Ensembl system and the latest developments (e.g. new species, outlook).</li>
  <li>Introduction to the Ensembl system</li>
  <li>Hands-on examples to introduce the system</li>
  <li>Evaluating genes and transcripts</li>
  <li>Data mining with EnsMart</li>
  <li>Comparative genomics and proteomics in Ensembl</li>
  <li>Variation (SNPs, haplotypes)</li>
  <li>Data mining is provided through EnsMart. Attendees will be introduced to several user interfaces designed to work with the system: (i) MartView - the web interface (ii) MartShell - a command-line tool, and (iii) MartExplorer - a java graphical user interface. These clients provide the user with the ability to create complex queries of data, and integrate data from BioMart datasets across the network.</li></p></ul>

<p><u>Pre-Requisites</u>: Course participants should have some biology background to understand different kinds of genomic annotation presented within Ensembl.</p>

<p>The deal is that you have to pay for travel and accommodation for someone,
but that is the only cost. For European travel this works out to be pretty
cheap (especially as we are close to Stanstead and Ryanair prices are just
silly). For US locations we would suggest both for your cost and the
sanity of the helpdesk people that two or three near-<em>ish</em> (in US terms...)
institutes organise a potential road-show.</p>


<p>The course requires an IT room of (say) 20 PC's with internet connection
and a way for one of the machines to be projected. The course lasts one
day and can be somewhat customised to the location. Usually one can have
up to 2 people per machine.</p>



<p>If people are interested in this, please contact Xos&#233
Fern&#225ndez (<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>) for more details and potential arrangements.

</h1>

<h3 align="center">June 22-23, 2006 - University of Minnesota - Twin Cities Campus<br></h3>


</p>



<p>Conference overview:
Mobile DNA or transposons serve as powerful gene transfer agents that are being harnessed in diverse applications. These agents are being combined with conventional and novel technologies for even broader utility. Recent advances including the exploitation of an array of invertebrate transposons in vertebrate models, and fish transposons in mammalian systems. In this meeting, the use of transposons for gene discovery and gene transfer approaches will be explored.

<p>Sessions include such topics as basic transposon biology, transposon applications in an array of model organisms from fish to mammals large and small, somatic cell usage from gene trapping to gene therapy, and novel approaches implementing nanotechnological tools for delivering and detecting transposon-based gene transfer. The goal is to serve as a key forum for information exchange and development of transposon tools for genetic applications from functional genomics to molecular medicine.

<p>Confirmed Speakers include:
<blockquote>
Dr. David Lampe, Duquesne University<br>
Dr. Malcolm Fraser, Notre Dame University<br>
Dr. Shannon Fisher, Johns Hopkins University<br>
Dr. Stephen Ekker, University of Minnesota<br>

 <h1 align="center"><a name="cruz">The Santa Cruz Conference on Developmental Biology</a></h1>

<h3 align="center">August 3-7, 2006, University of California Santa Cruz<br></h3>

<p><p>The Santa Cruz Conference on Developmental Biology is a highly interactive small meeting presenting the latest research in a beautiful and intimate setting at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Up to 200 participants can
attend the conference, which emphasizes molecular advances in development and pattern formation. In addition to the confirmed speakers, talks will be selected from the applicants.  There are two clear major goals of the meeting. The first is to teach each other. The planned program will be a superb course in advanced developmental biology, and help those working with each particular organism to keep abreast of exciting new developments in the study of other organisms. This will be important not just for established investigators, but also for the many students and postdoctoral fellows who will attend the meeting.  The second goal is communication to facilitate rapid research progress. We know of numerous collaborations that arose as a direct result of the last Santa Cruz meetings, and we anticipate more of the same.

<p>The invited participants are intentionally diverse, drawing together workers that study vertebrates, invertebrates and plants. Furthermore, the experimental strategies will be varied: talks will present experimental techniques ranging from experimental embryology and cell biology to genetics, genomics, molecular biology and biochemistry. The talks from each of these varied sub-areas will not be segregated into their own sessions; instead they will be integrated throughout the meeting to maximize interactions and emphasize interconnections.

<p>The meeting will offer ample opportunity for both formal and informal discussion among participants.

<p>This intensive two-week course for advanced graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and independent investigators focuses on the development and genetics of zebrafish with special emphasis on the nervous system. Mornings and afternoons are devoted mainly to laboratory exercises and the evenings to lectures and discussion. Limited to 18 students. </p>
<p>Lectures and labs in the first week introduce students to early development of the zebrafish embryo and to methods for manipulating and studying gene function, including mutant screening, mapping and cloning; transgenesis and antisense approaches; mosaic analysis; and in situ methods for detecting gene expression. In the second week, students are introduced to the nervous system of zebrafish, its organization and development, and methods for the analysis of nervous system mutants including visualizing single neurons in live embryos, labeling and analyzing axon projections and performing behavioral tests on live animals. Informal "round table" discussions held periodically during the course include the design and execution of mutant screens, and zebrafish breeding and husbandry. </p>
<p>In 2006 the subject of organogenesis will be introduced through the use of: of organ-specific GFP transgenes in genetic screens; methods for visualizing blood flow in live fish; and cell sorting methodologies using GFP-transgenic lines.  In addition the topic of chemical genetics and cancer biology, will be included using: methodologies for small molecule screening in the zebrafish; zebrafish tumor histology; and adult pathology.</p>
