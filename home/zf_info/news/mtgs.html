 <p>A Special Topics Course at the
Marine Biological Laboratory
Woods Hole, MA

<p>Directors:
<br>Mary Mullins, University of Pennsylvania
<br>Chi-Bin Chien, University of Utah

<p>Course Date: 		August 10 - 24, 2008

<p>Course Website  	<a href="http://courses.mbl.edu/zebrafish/">http://courses.mbl.edu/zebrafish/ </a>

<p>Financial assistance is available.

<p>This is an intensive two-week lecture-laboratory course taught by leaders in the field for advanced graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and independent investigators that will focus on the development and genetics of zebrafish with special emphasis on the nervous system.

<p>Students will learn methods for manipulating and studying gene function, including mutant screening, mapping and cloning; transgenesis and antisense approaches; mosaic analysis; and in situ methods for detecting gene expression. In addition students will be introduced to the nervous system of zebrafish, its organization and development, and methods for the analysis of nervous system mutants including visualizing single neurons in live embryos, labeling and analyzing axon projections, and performing behavioral tests on live animals.

<p>Partial funding for this course is provided by the National Institutes of Health and the Grass Foundation.

<p>Application Deadline: April 4, 2008

 <br>
 <p>
 Deadline of registrations and submissions of papers are JUNE 15 (LESS THAN 3 weeks). We are getting many papers. If you want to present your papers, it is strongly suggested to submit abstracts urgently as we will accept a limited number of papers (ORAL) due to the time constraint.
 
<p>If you need the official acceptance of your papers in order for you to get the authorization to attend the symposium, please send abstracts very urgently as it will take some time to evaluate the papers.
 
<p>If you have sent us your registration details, but you had not yet received your registration number, please re-send it again and get the number from us.
 
<p>Please note well that, if you register before June 15, the registration fee is US$200, but afterwards it will be US$400.
 
<p>Please also start to book rooms in one of 4 hotels reserved for the symposium along the Copacabana beach. If you want to save the accommodation cost, we will arrange to share the large room with other participants.
 
<p>Please also check if you need the visa to enter Brazil.

 <br>
 <p>Applications are being accepted for this 1-week short course for individuals with maintenance, management or research responsibilities in which fish are used as laboratory animals.

<p>APPLICATION DEADLINE - JULY 15.

<p>The course is offered at the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, Salisbury Cove, Maine during the period of 25 - 29 August 2008.  Topics to be discussed will include  general system design and water quality management, anatomy and histology of fish, general fish diseases and disease management strategies.  Infectious and non-infectious diseases common to all fish as well as specific diseases of importance to laboratory-maintained zebrafish will be discussed.  The course will consist of lecture, laboratory exercises and discussions. During the course there will be an opportunity for students to discuss unusual and/or unsolved diagnostic case experiences from their home laboratories as problem-solving exercises.  The course should be particularly valuable to technical staff, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, junior faculty and investigators needing skills to monitor the health of a colony of aquatic organisms.

 <br>
 <p>State of the art imaging is crucial for most of today's biomedical research. Advances in imaging technology enables us to produce excellent image data sets, yet the development of adequate data mining tools is lagging far behind.

 <p>This symposium sets out to initiate a platform for knowledge exchange in the field of image data extraction and image mining.

 <h1 align="center"><a name="ensembl">Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl</a></h1>
 <h3 align="center">At your Institute - worldwide<br></h3>
 <br>
 <p>Ensembl is a joint project of the European Bioinformatics Institute and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, funded mainly by the Wellcome Trust, with additional funding from EMBL and NIH-NIAID. These courses are coordinated by Xos&#233; M Fer&#225;ndez (<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>), member of the Ensembl team involved with user queries and workshops. Throughout the year we run a number of workshops, thus have developed a quite extensive 1-day course suitable for up to 30 people with a hands-on training aspect in Ensembl that should help the attendees get the most out of the system and apply it to their own projects. We are aiming to give this course once a month, and we are considering requests for this coming year (2005).</p>

<p> Workshop:<b> "Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl"</b><br>
 We will introduce the latest developments on the website, emphasising tools for data mining. Practical exercises will assist the researcher in learning to get the best out of the data available, and some time will be allocated for participants to query the Ensembl team about issues derived from their own research. Short presentations followed by case studies.</p>

<p>Topics covered will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Overview of the Ensembl system and the latest developments (e.g. new species, outlook).</li>
  <li>Introduction to the Ensembl system</li>
  <li>Hands-on examples to introduce the system</li>
  <li>Evaluating genes and transcripts</li>
  <li>Data mining with EnsMart</li>
  <li>Comparative genomics and proteomics in Ensembl</li>
  <li>Variation (SNPs, haplotypes)</li>
  <li>Data mining is provided through EnsMart. Attendees will be introduced to several user interfaces designed to work with the system: (i) MartView - the web interface (ii) MartShell - a command-line tool, and (iii) MartExplorer - a java graphical user interface. These clients provide the user with the ability to create complex queries of data, and integrate data from BioMart datasets across the network.</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Pre-Requisites</u>: Course participants should have some biology background to understand different kinds of genomic annotation presented within Ensembl.</p>

<p>The deal is that you have to pay for travel and accommodation for someone,
but that is the only cost. For European travel this works out to be pretty
cheap (especially as we are close to Stanstead and Ryanair prices are just
silly). For US locations we would suggest both for your cost and the
sanity of the helpdesk people that two or three near-<em>ish</em> (in US terms...)
institutes organise a potential road-show.</p>


<p>The course requires an IT room of (say) 20 PC's with internet connection
and a way for one of the machines to be projected. The course lasts one
day and can be somewhat customised to the location. Usually one can have
up to 2 people per machine.</p>



<p>If people are interested in this, please contact Xos&#233; Fern&#225;ndez
(<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>) for more details and potential arrangements.
