 <h1 align="center"><a name="ensembl">Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl</a></h1>

<h3 align="center">At your Institute - worldwide<br></h3>


<p>Ensembl is a joint project of the European Bioinformatics Institute and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, funded mainly by the Wellcome Trust, with additional funding from EMBL and NIH-NIAID. These courses are coordinated by Xos&#233 M Fer&#225ndez (<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>), member of the Ensembl team involved with user queries and workshops. Throughout the year we run a number of workshops, thus have developed a quite extensive 1-day course suitable for up to 30 people with a hands-on training aspect in Ensembl that should help the attendees get the most out of the system and apply it to their own projects. We are aiming to give this course once a month, and we are considering requests for this coming year (2005).</p>

<p> Workshop:<b> "Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl"</b><br>
 We will introduce the latest developments on the website, emphasising tools for data mining. Practical exercises will assist the researcher in learning to get the best out of the data available, and some time will be allocated for participants to query the Ensembl team about issues derived from their own research. Short presentations followed by case studies.</p>

<p>Topics covered will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Overview of the Ensembl system and the latest developments (e.g. new species, outlook).</li>
  <li>Introduction to the Ensembl system</li>
  <li>Hands-on examples to introduce the system</li>
  <li>Evaluating genes and transcripts</li>
  <li>Data mining with EnsMart</li>
  <li>Comparative genomics and proteomics in Ensembl</li>
  <li>Variation (SNPs, haplotypes)</li>
  <li>Data mining is provided through EnsMart. Attendees will be introduced to several user interfaces designed to work with the system: (i) MartView - the web interface (ii) MartShell - a command-line tool, and (iii) MartExplorer - a java graphical user interface. These clients provide the user with the ability to create complex queries of data, and integrate data from BioMart datasets across the network.</li></p></ul>

<p><u>Pre-Requisites</u>: Course participants should have some biology background to understand different kinds of genomic annotation presented within Ensembl.</p>

<p>The deal is that you have to pay for travel and accommodation for someone,
but that is the only cost. For European travel this works out to be pretty
cheap (especially as we are close to Stanstead and Ryanair prices are just
silly). For US locations we would suggest both for your cost and the
sanity of the helpdesk people that two or three near-<em>ish</em> (in US terms...)
institutes organise a potential road-show.</p>


<p>The course requires an IT room of (say) 20 PC's with internet connection
and a way for one of the machines to be projected. The course lasts one
day and can be somewhat customised to the location. Usually one can have
up to 2 people per machine.</p>



<p>If people are interested in this, please contact Xos&#233
Fern&#225ndez (<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>) for more details and potential arrangements.

<p>13th Annual University of Minnesota Developmental Biology Symposium<br>
From Egg to Organ: Development and Disease<br>
September 27-28, 2004</p>

<p>This year's Symposium will focus on development and disease. We will consider how pathogenic conditions can arise as a result of aberrant developmental mechanisms. Presentations will also explore how model organisms and genome projects further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie disease processes.</p>

<h1 align="center"><a name="Texas">Southern Regional Zebrafish Meeting (tentative)</a></h1>

<h3 align="center">May - June 2005<br> Rice University - Houston, Texas<br>
</h3>

<p>We are planning the Texas Regional Zebrafish meeting at Rice University in Houston, Texas in late May or June of 2005.  There has been considerable interest from researchers outside of Texas in attending a larger regional meeting.  We are considering expanding our Texas Regional Zebrafish meeting to a Southern Regional Zebrafish Meeting.  We want to gauge the interest in such a meeting to determine the scale and build a potential attendee e-mail list for updates.  If you are interested in attending a Southern Regional meeting please e-mail us at the address below.  We'll decide on the dates and format depending on the level of interest.  So respond early and we'll start planning what promises to be a fantastic forum for sharing our latest discoveries!</p>
