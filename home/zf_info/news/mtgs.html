 <h1 align="center"><a name="Workshop">Transcriptomics and Proteomics in Zebrafish</a></h1>

<h3 align="center">13 - 22 March, 2006 - Lorentz Center, Universiteit Leiden, The Netherlands<br></h3>

<p>Description and aim of the workshop<br>

<p>This workshop is organized in the framework of the European ZF-MODELS project: "Zebrafish Models for Human Development and Disease". The workshop will give an introduction to transcriptome microarray analysis and proteomics and is primarily intended for graduate students, postdocs and advanced technicians using zebrafish as research model. The workshop is aimed at providing knowledge on the use of different microarray platforms, RNA labelling techniques, protein extraction methods and 2D-electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, experimental design of genomic studies, statistical analysis of genomic data, linkage of datasets to the zebrafish genome and the use of public databases for storage of genomic data. The practical part will include RNA labeling, quality control and hybridization of oligonucleotide microarrays. Furthermore, the participants will be able to acquire practical experience with bioinformatic methods applied in genomics and proteomics.<br>

 <h1 align="center"><a name="ensembl">Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl</a></h1>

<h3 align="center">At your Institute - worldwide<br></h3>


<p>Ensembl is a joint project of the European Bioinformatics Institute and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, funded mainly by the Wellcome Trust, with additional funding from EMBL and NIH-NIAID. These courses are coordinated by Xos&#233 M Fer&#225ndez (<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>), member of the Ensembl team involved with user queries and workshops. Throughout the year we run a number of workshops, thus have developed a quite extensive 1-day course suitable for up to 30 people with a hands-on training aspect in Ensembl that should help the attendees get the most out of the system and apply it to their own projects. We are aiming to give this course once a month, and we are considering requests for this coming year (2005).</p>

<p> Workshop:<b> "Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl"</b><br>
 We will introduce the latest developments on the website, emphasising tools for data mining. Practical exercises will assist the researcher in learning to get the best out of the data available, and some time will be allocated for participants to query the Ensembl team about issues derived from their own research. Short presentations followed by case studies.</p>

<p>Topics covered will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Overview of the Ensembl system and the latest developments (e.g. new species, outlook).</li>
  <li>Introduction to the Ensembl system</li>
  <li>Hands-on examples to introduce the system</li>
  <li>Evaluating genes and transcripts</li>
  <li>Data mining with EnsMart</li>
  <li>Comparative genomics and proteomics in Ensembl</li>
  <li>Variation (SNPs, haplotypes)</li>
  <li>Data mining is provided through EnsMart. Attendees will be introduced to several user interfaces designed to work with the system: (i) MartView - the web interface (ii) MartShell - a command-line tool, and (iii) MartExplorer - a java graphical user interface. These clients provide the user with the ability to create complex queries of data, and integrate data from BioMart datasets across the network.</li></p></ul>

<p><u>Pre-Requisites</u>: Course participants should have some biology background to understand different kinds of genomic annotation presented within Ensembl.</p>

<p>The deal is that you have to pay for travel and accommodation for someone,
but that is the only cost. For European travel this works out to be pretty
cheap (especially as we are close to Stanstead and Ryanair prices are just
silly). For US locations we would suggest both for your cost and the
sanity of the helpdesk people that two or three near-<em>ish</em> (in US terms...)
institutes organise a potential road-show.</p>


<p>The course requires an IT room of (say) 20 PC's with internet connection
and a way for one of the machines to be projected. The course lasts one
day and can be somewhat customised to the location. Usually one can have
up to 2 people per machine.</p>



<p>If people are interested in this, please contact Xos&#233
Fern&#225ndez (<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>) for more details and potential arrangements.

 <h1 align="center"><a name="SICB"><i>"Zebrafish In Comparative Context"</i> Symposium<br>
 at the Society for Integrative & Comparative Biology (SICB) meeting</a></h1>

<h3 align="center">January 2006<br> Orlando, Florida<br></h3>

<p>This Symposium will provide a unique opportunity for interaction between scientists who study the comparative development of fishes in a phylogenetic context and those who use the molecular and genetic resources of the zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) model system to study fundamentals of vertebrate development.  Such an integration will broaden our understanding of the relationship between genotype and phenotype and stimulate discussions about how a comparative approach can help to generate new hypotheses about fundamental features of fish development and evolution. </p>

<h3 align="center">March 26-29, 2006<br>New York Academy of Medicine, New York City<br></h3>

<p>Website: <a href="http://www.anatomy.unimelb.edu.au/devens">www.anatomy.unimelb.edu.au/devens</a></p>

<p>Plenary speakers: Nicole Le Douarin, Aravinda Chakravarti and Michael Gershon</p>

<p>Other speakers include Judith Eisen, Robert Kelsh, Iain Shepherd, Sean Morrison, Vassilis Pachnis, Lukas Sommer</p>

<p>In the past 10 years, there have been a large number of studies published on the development of the enteric nervous system, including many studies in high impact journals such as Science, Nature, Development, Neuron, Nature Neuroscience, Nature Genetics, Gastroenterology, Journal of Neuroscience and Developmental Biology.  The developing enteric nervous system has proved to be an important and accessible model system to study, and has provided many insights into neural development and cell migration in general.  The studies have included a broad diversity of approaches.  The main objective of our meeting is to bring together, for the first time, the diversity of researchers interested in the development of the enteric nervous system - human and zebrafish geneticists, molecular and cell biologists, physiologists, pediatric pathologists, classical embryologists, mathematical modellers.  Our meeting will also be of interest to researchers interested in general aspects of Ret and endothelin-3 signaling, and in the transcription factor, Sox10, and its interactions.  All of the leading researchers in the field of enteric neuron development that we invited have accepted invitations to participate.</p>
