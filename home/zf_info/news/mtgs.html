 <h3 align="center">Starting in August 2009 at Sodertorn University, Stockholm (Huddinge), Sweden<br></h3>
 <br>
 <p>
Global emergence and re-emergence of major infectious diseases is a growing and potentially gigantic world problem. A consequence of globalization is that events in one part of the world may rapidly impact on the local health status of multiple other world locations. This program bridges medical, biological, and geographical aspects of infectious disease epidemiology. This unique multidisciplinary Master course (held in English), which is given in collaboration with the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control (SMI), is designed for science/medical students with special interest in spread and control of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.

 <p>The application procedure is now open until April 15, 2009. For application documents and information material please email to: Magnus Johansson <a href="mailto:magnus.johansson@sh.se">magnus.johansson@sh.se</a>

 <br>
 <p>
The availability of complete genome sequences of an increasing number of species is having a major impact on novel biomedical approaches to human disease. Biomedical sciences and animal model system-based research will thus be of high significance for future human medicine.</p>
<p>
The international Biomedical Genomics Master course is a collaboration between the School of Life Sciences at Sodertorn University and the Karolinska Institute Medical University, covering biological and medical aspects of genome sequence, gene expression and function in development, physiology and disease.</p> 
<p>	This unique biomedical Master course covers modern approaches to couple genes to diseases, and vice versa, e.g. translating genome structure and sequence into 
epigenetic regulation and gene function in cells, tissues and organs throughout animal development and in physiology. The course content is strongly based on animal model systems, e.g.<i> D. rerio, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster</i>. All courses are in English.</p>
<p>
Applications are accepted now, until April 15, 2009. Applications after April 15 are accepted on a space availability basis. For application documents and information material please email to: Per Kylsten  <a href="mailto:per.kylsten@sh.se">per.kylsten@sh.se</a>

 <p>APPLICATION DEADLINE - JULY 15.

 <p>The course is offered at the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, Salisbury Cove, Maine during the period of 16 - 20 August 2010.  Topics to be discussed will include general system design and water quality management, anatomy and histology of fish, general fish diseases and disease management strategies.  Infectious and non-infectious diseases common to all fish as well as specific diseases of importance to laboratory-maintained zebrafish will be discussed.  The course will consist of lecture, laboratory exercises and discussions. During the course there will be an opportunity for students to discuss unusual and/or unsolved diagnostic case experiences from their home laboratories as problem-solving exercises.

 <h3 align="center">September 2-3, 2010 - Karlsruhe, Germany <br></h3>
 <br>
 <p>
<a href="http://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=19192"> www.zebrafish-embryo.net</a>

 <p>The zebrafish, an established model in developmental genetics, is gaining increasing popularity in the area of toxicology, both in research and
potential regulatory applications. Particularly the use of embryos exhibits a number of advantages which make this model superior and/or complementary
to others. Embryos are considered as alternatives to animal testing. While providing an ethically acceptable small scale analysis system they exhibit
the complexity of a complete organism.

 <p>This is the first international workshop that aims to bring together scientist using the fish embryo model in the context of toxicology and teratology.
Keynote speakers will provide insight in the latest advancements in high throughput analysis, toxicogenomics and regulatory acceptance as replacement
for animal experiments. Oral and poster presentations by participants are welcome. Discussion groups will allow to identify major advantages,
limitations and future research needs of the zebrafish embryo model and to establish collaborations.

 <p>The workshop is organised by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) and the ECT
Oekotoxikologie GmbH. The registration is open now! We recommend to register as early as possible since the number of participants will be limited to
about 120. You can register now but submit your abstract later (deadline 15. July 2010). For more information and details please visit our workshop

 <h3 align="center">September 8-9, 2010 - London (UK)<br></h3>
 <br>
 <p>
The relative simple nervous system of the zebrafish shares many fundamental similarities with other vertebrates, including humans. Even complex brain function, such as emotional, motivational and cognitive processes are conserved and can be robustly assesed in zebrafish. The combination of this behavioral repertoire with its ever increasing genetic tool box makes the zebrafish an attractive model to study the genetic and pathophysiological basis of neurological and psychiatric diseases.

 

 <p>This workshop aims to bring bring together experts in neurobiology and behaviour to identify priority areas for research and to forge collaborations.

 <p>The number of participants is limited.

 <h1 align="center"><a name="ensembl">Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl</a></h1>
 <h3 align="center">At your Institute - worldwide<br></h3>
 <br>
 <p>Ensembl is a joint project of the European Bioinformatics Institute and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, funded mainly by the Wellcome Trust, with additional funding from EMBL and NIH-NIAID. These courses are coordinated by Xos&#233; M Fer&#225;ndez (<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>), member of the Ensembl team involved with user queries and workshops. Throughout the year we run a number of workshops, thus have developed a quite extensive 1-day course suitable for up to 30 people with a hands-on training aspect in Ensembl that should help the attendees get the most out of the system and apply it to their own projects. We are aiming to give this course once a month, and we are considering requests for this coming year (2005).</p>

<p> Workshop:<b> "Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl"</b><br>
 We will introduce the latest developments on the website, emphasising tools for data mining. Practical exercises will assist the researcher in learning to get the best out of the data available, and some time will be allocated for participants to query the Ensembl team about issues derived from their own research. Short presentations followed by case studies.</p>

<p>Topics covered will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Overview of the Ensembl system and the latest developments (e.g. new species, outlook).</li>
  <li>Introduction to the Ensembl system</li>
  <li>Hands-on examples to introduce the system</li>
  <li>Evaluating genes and transcripts</li>
  <li>Data mining with EnsMart</li>
  <li>Comparative genomics and proteomics in Ensembl</li>
  <li>Variation (SNPs, haplotypes)</li>
  <li>Data mining is provided through EnsMart. Attendees will be introduced to several user interfaces designed to work with the system: (i) MartView - the web interface (ii) MartShell - a command-line tool, and (iii) MartExplorer - a java graphical user interface. These clients provide the user with the ability to create complex queries of data, and integrate data from BioMart datasets across the network.</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Pre-Requisites</u>: Course participants should have some biology background to understand different kinds of genomic annotation presented within Ensembl.</p>

<p>The deal is that you have to pay for travel and accommodation for someone,
but that is the only cost. For European travel this works out to be pretty
cheap (especially as we are close to Stanstead and Ryanair prices are just
silly). For US locations we would suggest both for your cost and the
sanity of the helpdesk people that two or three near-<em>ish</em> (in US terms...)
institutes organise a potential road-show.</p>


<p>The course requires an IT room of (say) 20 PC's with internet connection
and a way for one of the machines to be projected. The course lasts one
day and can be somewhat customised to the location. Usually one can have
up to 2 people per machine.</p>



<p>If people are interested in this, please contact Xos&#233; Fern&#225;ndez
(<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>) for more details and potential arrangements.
