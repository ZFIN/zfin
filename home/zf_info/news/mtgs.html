 <h3 align="center">Starting in August 2009 at Sodertorn University, Stockholm (Huddinge), Sweden<br></h3>
 <br>
 <p>
Global emergence and re-emergence of major infectious diseases is a growing and potentially gigantic world problem. A consequence of globalization is that events in one part of the world may rapidly impact on the local health status of multiple other world locations. This program bridges medical, biological, and geographical aspects of infectious disease epidemiology. This unique multidisciplinary Master course (held in English), which is given in collaboration with the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control (SMI), is designed for science/medical students with special interest in spread and control of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.

 <p>The application procedure is now open until April 15, 2009. For application documents and information material please email to: Magnus Johansson <a href="mailto:magnus.johansson@sh.se">magnus.johansson@sh.se</a>

 <br>
 <p>
The availability of complete genome sequences of an increasing number of species is having a major impact on novel biomedical approaches to human disease. Biomedical sciences and animal model system-based research will thus be of high significance for future human medicine.</p>
<p>
The international Biomedical Genomics Master course is a collaboration between the School of Life Sciences at Södertörn University and the Karolinska Institute Medical University, covering biological and medical aspects of genome sequence, gene expression and function in development, physiology and disease.</p> 
<p>	This unique biomedical Master course covers modern approaches to couple genes to diseases, and vice versa, e.g. translating genome structure and sequence into 
epigenetic regulation and gene function in cells, tissues and organs throughout animal development and in physiology. The course content is strongly based on animal model systems, e.g.<i> D. rerio, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster</i>. All courses are in English.</p>

Applications are accepted now, until April 15, 2009. Applications after April 15 are accepted on a space availability basis. For application documents and information material please email to: Per Kylsten  <a href="mailto:per.kylsten@sh.se">per.kylsten@sh.se</a>

 <p>The focus of this meeting will be on the molecular control of vascular development, cell signaling pathways in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, and mechanisms of
patterning blood vessel growth and migration. As in previous DVB meetings, researchers working on vascular development in a wide variety of different models, including fish, mice, frogs, birds, flies, and cell culture, will come together to share the latest unpublished research in this fast-moving and exciting scientific discipline.

 <p>The connections between normal developmental control pathways and therapeutic interventions in tumor angiogenesis, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration and tissue ischemia are still not well understood, and this cutting-edge meeting will reveal the new targets for interventions in the future. The invited speakers are of outstanding caliber and represent some of the premiere research labs in the area of developmental vascular biology.  Plan to attend this highly focused workshop and we strongly urge you to submit an abstractÑthe deadline for abstract submission is December 1, 2009.

The US Zebrafish Community has grown from isolated labs with wildly varying husbandry protocols and little institutional regulation to hundreds of Zebrafish Labs across the country, supported by multiple organizations including the Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC), Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN) and the Zebrafish Husbandry Association (ZHA).  The move towards standardized practices continues as technicians, managers and veterinarians share information in forums such as this. Sometimes, however, it is easy to forget that we are part of an even larger whole.

 <p>Our efforts support a research community that works to solve some of society's most pressing problems, including cancer, genetic disorders, mental illness, heart disease, and environmental contamination.  This research community spans national boundaries, and as the husbandry community grows in organization and maturity, we too will establish a dialogue with those practicing zebrafish husbandry around the world.  We acknowledge that common interest and seek to promote an international dialogue in this program.

     <br>* Parallel Workshops with the aim of inviting a few scientists from fields other than zebrafish for "top down" round table discussions.
    <br> * Parallel Workgroups (EuFishBioMed) with the aim of preparing drafts of white papers and roadmaps specifically addressing issues within the European zebrafish community.
    <br> * Plenary Workgroups summarizing conclusions and planned future actions from parallel workgroups.

 <p>One session will be dedicated to allow discussions with companies and SMEs..
Registration information and preliminary program will be available soon.

 <h1 align="center"><a name="ensembl">Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl</a></h1>
 <h3 align="center">At your Institute - worldwide<br></h3>
 <br>
 <p>Ensembl is a joint project of the European Bioinformatics Institute and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, funded mainly by the Wellcome Trust, with additional funding from EMBL and NIH-NIAID. These courses are coordinated by Xos&#233; M Fer&#225;ndez (<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>), member of the Ensembl team involved with user queries and workshops. Throughout the year we run a number of workshops, thus have developed a quite extensive 1-day course suitable for up to 30 people with a hands-on training aspect in Ensembl that should help the attendees get the most out of the system and apply it to their own projects. We are aiming to give this course once a month, and we are considering requests for this coming year (2005).</p>

<p> Workshop:<b> "Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl"</b><br>
 We will introduce the latest developments on the website, emphasising tools for data mining. Practical exercises will assist the researcher in learning to get the best out of the data available, and some time will be allocated for participants to query the Ensembl team about issues derived from their own research. Short presentations followed by case studies.</p>

<p>Topics covered will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Overview of the Ensembl system and the latest developments (e.g. new species, outlook).</li>
  <li>Introduction to the Ensembl system</li>
  <li>Hands-on examples to introduce the system</li>
  <li>Evaluating genes and transcripts</li>
  <li>Data mining with EnsMart</li>
  <li>Comparative genomics and proteomics in Ensembl</li>
  <li>Variation (SNPs, haplotypes)</li>
  <li>Data mining is provided through EnsMart. Attendees will be introduced to several user interfaces designed to work with the system: (i) MartView - the web interface (ii) MartShell - a command-line tool, and (iii) MartExplorer - a java graphical user interface. These clients provide the user with the ability to create complex queries of data, and integrate data from BioMart datasets across the network.</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Pre-Requisites</u>: Course participants should have some biology background to understand different kinds of genomic annotation presented within Ensembl.</p>

<p>The deal is that you have to pay for travel and accommodation for someone,
but that is the only cost. For European travel this works out to be pretty
cheap (especially as we are close to Stanstead and Ryanair prices are just
silly). For US locations we would suggest both for your cost and the
sanity of the helpdesk people that two or three near-<em>ish</em> (in US terms...)
institutes organise a potential road-show.</p>


<p>The course requires an IT room of (say) 20 PC's with internet connection
and a way for one of the machines to be projected. The course lasts one
day and can be somewhat customised to the location. Usually one can have
up to 2 people per machine.</p>



<p>If people are interested in this, please contact Xos&#233; Fern&#225;ndez
(<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>) for more details and potential arrangements.
