 <h1 align="center"><a name="ensembl">Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl</a></h1>

<h3 align="center">At your Institute - worldwide<br></h3>


<p>Ensembl is a joint project of the European Bioinformatics Institute and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, funded mainly by the Wellcome Trust, with additional funding from EMBL and NIH-NIAID. These courses are coordinated by Xos&#233 M Fer&#225ndez (<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>), member of the Ensembl team involved with user queries and workshops. Throughout the year we run a number of workshops, thus have developed a quite extensive 1-day course suitable for up to 30 people with a hands-on training aspect in Ensembl that should help the attendees get the most out of the system and apply it to their own projects. We are aiming to give this course once a month, and we are considering requests for this coming year (2005).</p>

<p> Workshop:<b> "Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl"</b><br>
 We will introduce the latest developments on the website, emphasising tools for data mining. Practical exercises will assist the researcher in learning to get the best out of the data available, and some time will be allocated for participants to query the Ensembl team about issues derived from their own research. Short presentations followed by case studies.</p>

<p>Topics covered will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Overview of the Ensembl system and the latest developments (e.g. new species, outlook).</li>
  <li>Introduction to the Ensembl system</li>
  <li>Hands-on examples to introduce the system</li>
  <li>Evaluating genes and transcripts</li>
  <li>Data mining with EnsMart</li>
  <li>Comparative genomics and proteomics in Ensembl</li>
  <li>Variation (SNPs, haplotypes)</li>
  <li>Data mining is provided through EnsMart. Attendees will be introduced to several user interfaces designed to work with the system: (i) MartView - the web interface (ii) MartShell - a command-line tool, and (iii) MartExplorer - a java graphical user interface. These clients provide the user with the ability to create complex queries of data, and integrate data from BioMart datasets across the network.</li></p></ul>

<p><u>Pre-Requisites</u>: Course participants should have some biology background to understand different kinds of genomic annotation presented within Ensembl.</p>

<p>The deal is that you have to pay for travel and accommodation for someone,
but that is the only cost. For European travel this works out to be pretty
cheap (especially as we are close to Stanstead and Ryanair prices are just
silly). For US locations we would suggest both for your cost and the
sanity of the helpdesk people that two or three near-<em>ish</em> (in US terms...)
institutes organise a potential road-show.</p>


<p>The course requires an IT room of (say) 20 PC's with internet connection
and a way for one of the machines to be projected. The course lasts one
day and can be somewhat customised to the location. Usually one can have
up to 2 people per machine.</p>



<p>If people are interested in this, please contact Xos&#233
Fern&#225ndez (<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>) for more details and potential arrangements.

 <h1 align="center"><a name="leiden">Model systems for infectious disease and cancer in zebrafish</a></h1>

<h3 align="center">July 16 - 18, Leiden, The Netherlands<br></h3>


</p>



<p>Description and aim of the work shop

<p>Studies of the molecular and cellular basis of vertebrate development increasingly make use of the zebrafish as a model test organism. This workshop will bring together molecular research in cancer and infectious disease, with the use of zebrafish as a uniting theme. Particular emphasis will be on the mechanisms of cellular immunity in relation to these diseases.

<p>The zebrafish offers many exciting possibilities to unravel the molecular mechanism of disease processes. First of all its optical transparency enables the use of optical imaging techniques for monitoring cellular processes at the molecular level in an entire vertebrate organism. Given the great advances in microscopic and biophysical analyses methods this offers novel opportunities to understand the signal transduction pathways underlying disease phenomena. Secondly, the cellular disease processes can be monitored in the early stages of disease at resolution and time scales that are more relevant than is possible using alternative models, such as MRI or luminescence analysis in rodents. Thirdly, considering the small size of the test organism the measurements at the molecular and cellular levels can be integrated with data obtained at the whole organism level, especially since fluorescence multicolor labeling techniques enable the causative agent of the disease (e.g. invading micro-organisms or cancer cells) to be easily detectable at all dimensions of measurement. Last but not least, due to its amenability to forward genetic screens the zebrafish is powerful for discovery of novel gene functions in disease processes. Given the strong relatedness of the zebrafish immune system to that of humans it is possible in many cases to link new molecular and cellular insights to models that can be used for medical science or device high-through-put test systems for pharmaceutical screens to discover new therapeutics.

<h3 align="center">September 17 - 22, 2007 - Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, Salisbury Cove, Maine <br></h3>


</p>



<p> This course is a 1-week educational opportunity for
individuals with maintenance, management or research responsibilities in
which fish are used as laboratory animals. The course is offered at the
Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, Salisbury Cove, Maine during
the period of 17 - 22 September 2007.  Topics to be discussed will
include general system design and water quality management, anatomy and
histology of fish, general fish diseases and disease management strategies.
Infectious and non-infectious diseases common to all fish as well as
specific diseases of importance to laboratory-maintained zebrafish will
be discussed.  

<p>The course will consist of lecture, laboratory exercises and
discussions. During the course there will be an opportunity for students
to discuss unusual and/or unsolved diagnostic case experiences from
their home laboratories as problem-solving exercises. The course should be
particularly valuable to technical staff, graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows, junior faculty and investigators needing skills to monitor the
health of a colony of aquatic organisms.

<h3 align="center">June 25-29, 2008 - Madison, WI, USA <br></h3>


</p>



<p>This meeting will cover all aspects of the biology of zebrafish, as well as medaka and other allied teleost models. Following in the tradition of past conferences, the schedule will feature a variety of oral sessions, posters, workshops, and vendors, as well as opportunities to socialize on the shores of Lake Mendota. In response to requests from community, the organizers plan to provide more time for informal discussions, expand the workshop format, and help to expedite travel to Madison, especially for international attendees.

<p>Please join us for an exciting program that will reflect the rapid expansion and growing impact of our field. Registration information and preliminary program will be available in late 2007.
