The objectives of this course are to teach genetic and molecular embryological
techniques for analysing gene function, cell fate and tissue interactions in
model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster,  zebrafish, chick and
Caenorhabditis elegans. The course is aimed primarily at active researchers in
the field of developmental biology and also at more clinically oriented workers
seeking to exploit model organisms for the analysis of human disease
mechanisms. Students may be senior pre-doctoral as well as post-doctoral and
will be selected on the basis of scientific merit and needs. There will be no
charge for board and lodging and no course fee. Please see the web pages at the
above address for details on how to apply.<br>
