 <br>
 <p>
Global emergence and re-emergence of major infectious diseases is a growing and potentially gigantic world problem. A consequence of globalization is that events in one part of the world may rapidly impact on the local health status of multiple other world locations. This program bridges medical, biological, and geographical aspects of infectious disease epidemiology. This unique multidisciplinary Master course (held in English), which is given in collaboration with the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control (SMI), is designed for science/medical students with special interest in spread and control of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.

 <p>The application procedure is now open until April 15, 2009. For application documents and information material please email to: Magnus Johansson <a href="mailto:magnus.johansson@sh.se">magnus.johansson@sh.se</a>

 <br>
 <p>
The availability of complete genome sequences of an increasing number of species is having a major impact on novel biomedical approaches to human disease. Biomedical sciences and animal model system-based research will thus be of high significance for future human medicine.</p>
<p>
The international Biomedical Genomics Master course is a collaboration between the School of Life Sciences at Södertörn University and the Karolinska Institute Medical University, covering biological and medical aspects of genome sequence, gene expression and function in development, physiology and disease.</p> 
<p>	This unique biomedical Master course covers modern approaches to couple genes to diseases, and vice versa, e.g. translating genome structure and sequence into 
epigenetic regulation and gene function in cells, tissues and organs throughout animal development and in physiology. The course content is strongly based on animal model systems, e.g.<i> D. rerio, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster</i>. All courses are in English.</p>
<p>
Applications are accepted now, until April 15, 2009. Applications after April 15 are accepted on a space availability basis. For application documents and information material please email to: Per Kylsten  <a href="mailto:per.kylsten@sh.se">per.kylsten@sh.se</a>

 <p>Methods in ZebraFish Behavior analysis is the premier meeting for scientists willing to analyze zebrafish's behavioral or physiological data by mean of imaging techniques.
This year we will also promote networking among European University and Industries willing to deploy ZebraFish in their facilities.

 <p>High throughput ZebraFish studies involves an increasing number of labs around the world.
But when setting up an experimental protocol, a number of challenges arise.
Based on successful "user case" experience, the meeting presentations will highlight the key steps to design and analyze your experiment.

<blockquote>
 <br>The presentations will be focused on the technical aspects of behavior analysis.
 <br>New technologies in ZebraFish Behavior analysis will be demonstrated.
 <br>The round tables will let us debate on the needs of the zebrafish community.

 <h3 align="center">June 16, 2010 - Madison, Wisconsin<br></h3>
 <br>
 <p>
In association with the 9th International Meeting on Zebrafish Development and Genetics and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, we are pleased to announce a one day "Working with Zebrafish Genome Resources" Workshop on the 16th of June 2010 in Madison.

 <p>The Open Door Workshop provides an introduction to bioinformatics tools freely available on the internet, focussing primarily on the Zebrafish Genome data. The workshop features hands-on training in the use of public databases and web-based sequence analysis tools, and is taught by experienced instructors.

 <p>Applications are now open, more information can be found at <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/workshops/opendoor/madison.html">http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/workshops/opendoor/madison.html</a>.

 <h3 align="center">June 21-24, 2010 - Boston, MA<br></h3>
 <br>
 <p>
This workshop focuses on cancer models and infection studies prompted by the prediction that similarities between defense mechanisms against microbes and cancer cells can reveal new insights into specific determinants of innate immune responses.

 <p>Due to the amenability of zebrafish to screening libraries of small molecules, in addition to large scale forward and reverse genetic screens, this model organism is ideal for discovery of novel gene functions and pathways in disease processes at a throughput level that cannot be matched by rodent models. Furthermore, owing to its small size and optical transparency, disease manifestations and resulting immune responses can be studied at the whole organism level.

 <p>Particularly advantageous in this context are fluorescence multicolor labeling techniques that allow tagging of the players in disease processes (e.g. cancer cells, immune cells, and microbes) for easy detection in vivo.


 <p>Registraion is now open. Everyone must register including speakers. Currently we are only accepting check as our only form of payment.
 <p>
 Due to the overwhelming response registration has been extended until April 2, 2010
 
 <p> Abstract/title/poster submissions are due by April 1st, 2010

 <h1 align="center"><a name="ensembl">Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl</a></h1>
 <h3 align="center">At your Institute - worldwide<br></h3>
 <br>
 <p>Ensembl is a joint project of the European Bioinformatics Institute and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, funded mainly by the Wellcome Trust, with additional funding from EMBL and NIH-NIAID. These courses are coordinated by Xos&#233; M Fer&#225;ndez (<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>), member of the Ensembl team involved with user queries and workshops. Throughout the year we run a number of workshops, thus have developed a quite extensive 1-day course suitable for up to 30 people with a hands-on training aspect in Ensembl that should help the attendees get the most out of the system and apply it to their own projects. We are aiming to give this course once a month, and we are considering requests for this coming year (2005).</p>

<p> Workshop:<b> "Access to genes and genomes with Ensembl"</b><br>
 We will introduce the latest developments on the website, emphasising tools for data mining. Practical exercises will assist the researcher in learning to get the best out of the data available, and some time will be allocated for participants to query the Ensembl team about issues derived from their own research. Short presentations followed by case studies.</p>

<p>Topics covered will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Overview of the Ensembl system and the latest developments (e.g. new species, outlook).</li>
  <li>Introduction to the Ensembl system</li>
  <li>Hands-on examples to introduce the system</li>
  <li>Evaluating genes and transcripts</li>
  <li>Data mining with EnsMart</li>
  <li>Comparative genomics and proteomics in Ensembl</li>
  <li>Variation (SNPs, haplotypes)</li>
  <li>Data mining is provided through EnsMart. Attendees will be introduced to several user interfaces designed to work with the system: (i) MartView - the web interface (ii) MartShell - a command-line tool, and (iii) MartExplorer - a java graphical user interface. These clients provide the user with the ability to create complex queries of data, and integrate data from BioMart datasets across the network.</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Pre-Requisites</u>: Course participants should have some biology background to understand different kinds of genomic annotation presented within Ensembl.</p>

<p>The deal is that you have to pay for travel and accommodation for someone,
but that is the only cost. For European travel this works out to be pretty
cheap (especially as we are close to Stanstead and Ryanair prices are just
silly). For US locations we would suggest both for your cost and the
sanity of the helpdesk people that two or three near-<em>ish</em> (in US terms...)
institutes organise a potential road-show.</p>


<p>The course requires an IT room of (say) 20 PC's with internet connection
and a way for one of the machines to be projected. The course lasts one
day and can be somewhat customised to the location. Usually one can have
up to 2 people per machine.</p>



<p>If people are interested in this, please contact Xos&#233; Fern&#225;ndez
(<a href="mailto:xose@ebi.ac.uk">xose@ebi.ac.uk</a>) for more details and potential arrangements.
