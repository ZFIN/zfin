<center><strong>(University of Michigan)</strong></center><br>

<p>
The Kuwada lab seeks a postdoc to analyze the function of a gene that is required for formation of the nerve/muscle synapse in zebrafish. We have identified a zebrafish mutation in a gene that regulates the development of the neuromuscular junction. The gene encodes a muscle receptor for a signaling molecule secreted by the terminals of motor neurons that is necessary for the accumulation of neurotransmitter receptors at the neuromuscular junction. The project includes the generation of transgenic zebrafish in which various mutated versions of this gene are expressed by mutant muscles in order to assay how different domains of the receptor contribute to synapse formation. Experience with molecular biology, immunocytochemistry and biochemistry are highly desired for this project. The position is available now and is funded by a NIH grant. Please contact John Kuwada (<a href="mailto:kuwada@umich.edu">kuwada@umich.edu</a>) for more information.

<p>
3-year Ph.D. Studentship starting Autumn 2010
The University of Sheffield has a long-standing tradition and world-wide reputation for top-level molecular biological research. The Department of Neuroscience is based in the University of Sheffield School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences and collaborates with the MRC Centre for Developmental and Biomedical Genetics.  A new state of the art research facility, which includes a drug screening laboratory at the Sheffield Institute for Translational Neurosciences (SITraN) is scheduled for completion in summer 2010.  The MRC Centre for Developmental and Biomedical Genetics (refurbished 2006) is fully equipped for work with zebrafish, and has recently expanded its capacity to over 23,000 litres capable of holding approximately 80,000 fish. Thus it is one of the largest zebrafish research facilities in the Europe.  The UK Universities Research Assessment Exercise (RAE-2007) panel ranked the Neurology unit headed by Prof. Shaw as among the top-8 in UK. The MRC Centre with whom we have an ongoing collaboration is a leader in utilizing zebrafish in biomedical research. The overall goal of both centres is to translate basic science into new therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. 

<p>The laboratory of Dr. Tennore Ramesh and Prof. Pamela Shaw at the Department of Neurosciences are currently offering a PhD studentship that will provide generous stipend for 3 years.  The student will get an opportunity to conduct research in the new state of the art research facility at SiTraN and work on developing and utilizing zebrafish models of MND in target and drug discovery.  Current projects in the Ramesh laboratory include (1) Developing zebrafish models of motor neuron disease (MND) (2) Study neurodegeneration and regeneration in a sod1 zebrafish model of MND. 3) Identify cellular changes/phenotypes in early embryonic stages to develop new tools for HT genetic and pharmacological screens.

<center><strong>(Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee WI)</strong></center><br>

<p>
Multiple post-doctoral positions are open in the Developmental Vascular Biology program in the Ramchandran Lab at the Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee WI. The Developmental Vascular Biology program investigates the basic mechanisms of blood vessel formation in vertebrates and the contribution of the vasculature to disease states. We study how a specified endothelial precursor cell (angioblast) eventually differentiates into artery or vein. The basic mechanisms of this process often are dysregulated in disease. Therefore, understanding the basic mechanisms of vessel formation will generate new treatments for conditions affected by deregulated vessel growth.

<p>For additional information, please visit the web site <a href="http://www.chw.org/vascularbiology">http://www.chw.org/vascularbiology</a>

<p>Applicants interested in studying vasculogenesis, angiogenesis or small molecule chemical biology approaches in zebrafish are welcome. Applicants are expected to be highly motivated, and willing to think out of the box. Experience in zebrafish or other developmental model systems preferred but not necessary. Excellent Molecular Biology skills are desirable. A strong sense of team environment and yearning knowledge is key as well. To apply for this position, please send an email with a recent CV, and names of three references to <a href="mailto:rramchan@mcw.edu">rramchan@mcw.edu</a>.

<center><strong>(Stanford University, Stanford, CA)</strong></center><br>

<p>
We are seeking to fill a postdoctoral position with a project focus on zebrafish development in the Riedel-Kruse Lab, Bioengineering Department, Stanford. 

<p>We are fascinated by the emergent dynamics of biological systems - with one focus of our lab on understanding how genetic networks orchestrate the dynamics and mechanics of developing embryos. We take a physics approach by iterating between mathematical models and quantitative experiments. Zebrafish is particularly amenable to this approach due to its fast and external development, optical transparency, large number of eggs in a clutch needed for statistics, and the variety of genetic tools available. Our work will result in new quantitative methods to monitor and perturb these genetic networks, and we aim for conceptually deeper insights into key developmental principles such as the utility of entrained genetic oscillators and mechanical forces / motors for the patterning of a growing tissue. Please see Riedel-Kruse, I.H., Muller, C., and Oates, A.C.; Synchrony dynamics during initiation, failure and rescue of the segmentation clock. Science (2007) 317: 1911; or visit our website at <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/riedel-kruse/">http://www.stanford.edu/group/riedel-kruse/</a>

<p>This position offers the interdisciplinary advantages of Stanford in general, and the Bioengineering and Developmental Biology departments, in particular. Multiple groups working on Zebrafish provide a vibrant and interactive community; the embedding of our lab in the Bioengineering Department facilitates collaborations on many emerging technologies.

<p>You should be highly motivated and technically accomplished as documented by an exceptional publication record. The ideal candidate will have demonstrated experience with vertebrate developmental model systems and a strong background in molecular biology. Prior experience with zebrafish is desired, but not essential. Experience with computational and theoretical approaches would be a plus, but are not explicitly required - and this position particularly offers the opportunity to develop and strengthen this skill set within our interdisciplinary environment. Most of all, we value curiosity, creativity, and a pleasant personality.

<p>Please email CV incl. a list of relevant publications to the contact information below. Applicants accepted for initial consideration will be subsequently contacted for letters of reference. Please also mention whether you plan to travel to the bay area in the near future, or plan to attend relevant meetings (especially the Zebrafish meeting in Madison, June 16th-20th).

Multiple postdoctoral positions are currently open in the Lawson Laboratory in the Program in Gene Function and Expression, University of Massachusetts Medical School.

<p>Generation of novel zebrafish gene knock-out models for the study of angiogenesis.
A postdoctoral position is available to apply zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) technology to generate zebrafish knock-out models related to blood vessel development. This position will provide a unique opportunity to exploit and further develop ZFN technology in zebrafish as part of an ongoing collaborative effort between the neighboring laboratories of Drs. Nathan Lawson and Scot Wolfe. This effort will provide the successful applicant with the opportunity to master modular- and selection-based systems used to generate and evaluate site-specific ZFNs. The genetic models developed in the context of these studies will be used to address questions of interest relating to endothelial cell differentiation and angiogenesis. Particular emphasis will be on the application of ZFNs in the context of a reverse genetic screen to interrogate novel regulators of vascular development, as well as development of zebrafish models for vascular disease.


<p>Studying blood vessel formation and function using the zebrafish as a model system.
A postdoctoral position is available to utilize the zebrafish as a model system to study blood vessel development. Areas of particular interest include the following: transcriptional regulatory networks required for endothelial specification and blood vessel identity, the role of Notch signaling during vascular development, how mechanosensory inputs are integrated with developmental signaling pathways during blood vessel morphogenesis, and the role of microRNAs in vascular development. We take full advantage of the many benefits of the zebrafish model including the application of in vivo imaging by 2-photon microscopy, genetic manipulation through the use of zinc finger nucleases, and development of transgenic sensor lines for visualizing signaling outputs in vivo.

<p>
A postdoctoral research position is available immediately at the Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah in the laboratory of Dr. Cicely Jette.  In my lab, we use the forward genetic capacity of the zebrafish model system to identify novel genes required to protect cells from DNA damage. The proteins encoded by these genes are potential therapeutic targets whose inactivation will re-sensitize cancer cells that have become resistant to DNA-damage-inducing therapies. To this end, we have identified a number of zebrafish lines harboring ENU-induced mutations in novel radioprotective genes.  Current projects involve dissecting the functions of these genes through 1) genetic epistasis analysis in zebrafish embryos, 2) biochemical analysis in mammalian cell culture and 3) analysis of therapeutic potential using a zebrafish model of radioresistant T-cell leukemia.

<p>Lateral line hair cells are homologous to inner ear hair cells of higher vertebrates. However, in mammals, hair cells do not regenerate and their loss is the leading cause of deafness. We are looking for a talented, highly motivated biologist to carry out studies aimed to molecularly dissect hair cell regeneration in the zebrafish. Applicants should have a strong record of accomplishment and experience in one or more of the following areas: Molecular techniques, bioinformatics, cell biology, developmental or regeneration biology. The project involves FACS studies, microarray analysis, as well as functional analyses of candidate genes. The work is done collaboratively with the Sanchez Alvarado lab with the later lab focused on the employment of bioinformatic approaches (<a href="http://planaria.neuro.utah.edu/">http://planaria.neuro.utah.edu/</a>). The University of Utah is a nationally and internationally recognized center for both zebrafish and regeneration biology, and provides a very stimulating and interactive research environment.

<p>To apply please send a curriculum vitae, statement of research interests, and three reference letters of past advisors or mentors to:
