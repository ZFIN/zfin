<center><strong>(University of Pittsburgh )</strong></center><br>


<p>
An NIH-funded postdoctoral position in the Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Pittsburgh, is available immediately to study vascular development using the zebrafish as a model system.  Our laboratory employs a diverse array of molecular, biochemical, imaging, and embryological techniques to elucidate genetic pathways that control vascular development.   Specifically, we are interested in the role of the TGF-beta type I receptor, ALK1, in vascular development and disease.  ALK1 function is critical in vascular development and homeostasis: homozygous ALK1 mutations are embryonic lethal, whereas the heterozygous condition results in the autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia, Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia Type 2 (HHT2).  Our laboratory is interested in investigating the regulation of alk1 expression; identifying downstream targets of Alk1 activation; and probing the cellular role of Alk1 within the endothelium.

<p>Our department is home to an interactive group of Developmental Biologists studying a variety of developmental processes in zebrafish, Drosophila, mouse, and C. elegans. Our laboratory is also part of an active and growing zebrafish community on the University of Pittsburgh campus, as well as the campus-wide Center for Vascular Remodeling and Regeneration.
 
<p>Qualified candidates must have a PhD and less than 3 years post-doctoral experience,  and a strong publication record.  Developmental Biology and/or molecular biology experience required; expertise in mechanotransduction preferred.  Interested candidates should send (1) a brief cover letter summarizing scientific accomplishments and stating future research goals; (2) a full CV; and (3) full contact information for three references to:

Postdoctoral Research Positions in Neuronal Regeneration

<p>Department of Biological Sciences and Center for Zebrafish Research
University of Notre Dame

<p>Two open postdoctoral research positions are available at any time in the next 6 months to study regeneration of the light-damaged zebrafish retina (Vihtelic and Hyde (2000) J. Neurobiol. 44: 289-307). We are interested in identifying molecular signals that induce and regulate the regeneration response and the signals that guide the neuronal progenitor cells only to the damaged retinal layer. We use a variety of techniques to approach these questions, including gene microarrays to identify candidate genes involved at specific stages of regeneration (Kassen et al. (2007) Dev. Neurobiol. 67: 1009-1031) and electroporation of morpholinos to conditionally knockdown specific proteins in the regenerating adult retina to test the functional significance of candidate proteins (Thummel et al. (2008) Dev. Neurobiol. 68: 392-408). 

<p>We are looking for talented individuals who are experienced in a wide variety of fields. More experienced individuals may be considered to be hired at the non-tenure track Research Assistant Professor level. The positions are funded by both NIH grants and a large annual budget provided by the University. Opportunities also exist for the successful candidate to gain some teaching experience, if desired. 

<p>Interested candidates should Email a cv and description of their previous research experience to Dr. David Hyde (<a href="mailto:dhyde@nd.edu">dhyde@nd.edu</a>). Candidates should also arrange three letters of recommendation to be Emailed directly to David Hyde.
