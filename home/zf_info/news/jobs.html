<center><strong>(University of Pittsburgh )</strong></center><br>


<p>
An NIH-funded postdoctoral position in the Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Pittsburgh, is available immediately to study vascular development using the zebrafish as a model system.  Our laboratory employs a diverse array of molecular, biochemical, imaging, and embryological techniques to elucidate genetic pathways that control vascular development.   Specifically, we are interested in the role of the TGF-beta type I receptor, ALK1, in vascular development and disease.  ALK1 function is critical in vascular development and homeostasis: homozygous ALK1 mutations are embryonic lethal, whereas the heterozygous condition results in the autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia, Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia Type 2 (HHT2).  Our laboratory is interested in investigating the regulation of alk1 expression; identifying downstream targets of Alk1 activation; and probing the cellular role of Alk1 within the endothelium.

<p>Our department is home to an interactive group of Developmental Biologists studying a variety of developmental processes in zebrafish, Drosophila, mouse, and C. elegans. Our laboratory is also part of an active and growing zebrafish community on the University of Pittsburgh campus, as well as the campus-wide Center for Vascular Remodeling and Regeneration.
 
<p>Qualified candidates must have a PhD and less than 3 years post-doctoral experience,  and a strong publication record.  Developmental Biology and/or molecular biology experience required; expertise in mechanotransduction preferred.  Interested candidates should send (1) a brief cover letter summarizing scientific accomplishments and stating future research goals; (2) a full CV; and (3) full contact information for three references to:

We use a variety of techniques to approach these questions, including gene microarrays to identify candidate genes involved at specific stages of regeneration (Kassen et al. (2007) Dev. Neurobiol. 67: 1009-1031) and electroporation of morpholinos to conditionally knockdown specific proteins in the regenerating adult retina to test the functional significance of candidate proteins (Thummel et al.

<p>
A postdoctoral position is available immediately in the laboratory of Dr.
Fang Lin in the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Iowa.
The laboratory is interested in studying G protein couple receptors and G
protein signaling in zebrafish embryogenesis. These studies will employ a
combination of genetic, genomic, cellular, and biochemical techniques. A
highly motivated Ph.D. with experience in the study of signal transduction,
developmental and molecular biology is desired. Previous experience with the
zebrafish model is preferable, but not a requirement, as training will be
provided.

<p>Iowa City is a very nice, safe and collegial town with high living
standards, but inexpensive cost of living as compared to larger cities.
Recent survey ranks UI as top University for postdoctoral students
