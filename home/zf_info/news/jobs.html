<p>Applications are invited for a Postdoctoral Fellow (Ph.D.) and a Research Assistant (B.Sc./M.Sc. level) position available early in 2006.  Our lab is situated within the UCD Conway Institute which provides state-of-the-art facilites for genomics, proteomics, and microscopy (<a href="http://www.ucd.ie/conway/">http://www.ucd.ie/conway/</a>).</p> 

<p>Zebrafish (Danio rerio), small tropical fish, have emerged as a prolific, vertebrate model for genetic and developmental studies.  We apply the zebrafish model to investigate cone photoreceptor development and disease.  Cone photoreceptors are critical for sharp, colour vision in daylight and loss of cone photoreceptors leads to severe blindness. </p>

<p>Our interests are to identify key regulators that direct cone photoreceptor development and differentiation, and to identify therapeutic targets for cone disease.  Our approaches include genetic screens, transgenesis, fluorescent-activated cell sorting and microarray analysis. </p>

<p><center><strong>(Danio Labs Ltd. - Cambridge UK)</strong></center></p><br>
<p>DanioLabs is a Cambridge (UK) based therapeutics company that uses phenotype driven drug discovery technologies to identify novel treatments for a variety of human diseases. A major part of the DanioLabs' platform involves the use of zebrafish as an experimental species. Using these models, the Company is able to identify activity of experimental compounds, and to provide the additional evidence relevant to the treatment of the disease needed to progress such compounds cost-effectively through the drug development process.</p>
<p>As a result of recent successes, DanioLabs is expanding its operations and is looking to recruit an outstanding post-doctoral researcher to join our program in the identification of therapeutics for multiple sclerosis.  DanioLabs strategy focuses on identifying molecules which promote remyelination of the nervous system and utilises proprietary high throughput in vivo models in larval zebrafish, coupled with systematic, compound screens.  The zebrafish work integrates into a wider program of therapy identification in multiple sclerosis encompassing inter-linked basic science and clinical work in the Cambridge area.</p>
<p>The successful individual will have exceptional scientific acumen as well as leadership skills.  He/she should have either a proven track record in developmental biology or experience in the field of oligodendrocyte biology.  Experience in working with zebrafish would be an advantage but is not essential.  The position will provide unique training exposure, exceptional publication opportunities and future career enhancement and flexibility, in a dynamic and friendly commercial environment.</p>
<p>Applicants should send their CV, full publication list and details of 2 referees to <a href="mailto:recruitment@daniolabs.com">recruitment@daniolabs.com</a>. Closing date 2nd December 2005.</p>

<p><b>Functional analysis of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase family in zebrafish</b></p>
<p>Dr. Jeroen den Hertog, at the Hubrecht Laboratory, has a position available for a
PhD student (m/f)</p>

<p>This is a multidisciplinary project within a dynamic research group working on signaling mediated by the protein-tyrosine phosphatase family. Protein phosphorylation on tyrosine residues is one of the most important cell signaling mechanisms, and is regulated by two families of enzymes with antagonistic activity, the protein-tyrosine kinases and the protein-tyrosine phosphatases. The goal of this project is to identify protein-tyrosine phosphatases that have essential roles in early zebrafish development by systematic knock down of each protein-tyrosine phosphatase. Emphasis will be placed on analysis of morphological defects and on defects in cell movement during gastrulation. The ultimate goal is to establish the molecular basis of the role of protein-tyrosine phosphatases in development. The candidate will use a range of techniques, including molecular biology, developmental biology, biochemistry and bioinformatics that are available within our research groups and he/she will write a thesis in order to obtain his/her PhD.</p>


<p>The Hubrecht Laboratory, Netherlands Institute for Developmental Biology of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, is a research institute comprising 15 research groups which focus on a wide variety of topics concerning developmental genetics and disease. The Institute provides a highly interactive research environment with excellent central research facilities and is directed by Prof. Ronald Plasterk and Prof. Hans Clevers. The Institute has close connections with Utrecht University and plays a central role in the Utrecht Graduate School for Developmental Biology in which the Hubrecht PhD students participate.</p>

<p>This position is funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), Research Council for Earth and Life Sciences (ALW).</p>

<p>Applicants should have a university degree (Drs./MSc) in biology, biochemistry or biomedical sciences. A strong background in molecular biology, developmental biology or biochemistry is preferred.</p>

<p>This position is funded for 4 years according to the CAO-Nederlandse Universiteiten (CAO-NU): ? 1,867 in the first year, increasing to ? 2,394 in the fourth year, excluding 8% holiday pay and a year-end bonus. We offer an extensive package of fringe benefits.</p>

<p>Based in the 5* rated Institute of Human Genetics this post, funded by
Heart Research UK, involves the characterisation of cardiac pathology in
a zebrafish model of dystrophin deficiency. You will analyse the
expression of dystrophin in the zebrafish heart and investigate the
progressive dilated cardiomyopathy caused by a dystrophin mutation. This
phenotype is similar to that seen in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and
you will assess the suitability of this model for high throughput drug
and mutation screening for therapies using transgenesis, drug testing,
gene expression and in vivo analysis.</p>

<p>The University of Newcastle and the Institute of Human Genetics are a
centre of excellence in the genetics of both the muscular dystrophies
and cardiac development and disease, providing a strong,
highly-collaborative and well-equipped environment. You will require a
high level of self-motivation, good teamworking skills, meticulous
attention to detail and an enthusiastic approach to your work. Tenable
for two years in the first instance. For informal enquiries please

The project will involve analysis of transgenic animals, the generation of transient morpholino knock down models in the zebrafish, and the generation of knockout mouse models.</p>

<b>Requirements</b><br>
<p>We seek a creative, strongly motivated and hardworking PhD student (AIO) with an interest in cardiovascular research. The candidate should have a biomedical background with experience in molecular biology and cell biology techniques. Experience with bioinformatics is desirable but not required (BLAST, Celera searches). </p>

<b>Arbeidsvoorwaarden</b><br>
<p>The PhD student will be recruited for a period of 4 years leading to a PhD thesis defense. According to the CAO-Nederlandse Universiteiten (CAO-NU): 1,867 Euro in the first year, increasing to 2,394 Euro in the fourth year, excluding 8% holiday pay.
