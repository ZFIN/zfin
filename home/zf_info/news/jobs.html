<p>The Institute of Research in Ophthalmology (IRO) is looking for a talented young PhD to setup a new developmental program in zebrafish.  In this position, he/she will be responsible to dissect the molecular mechanisms implicated in the development of the eye and, using the zebrafish as a model organism, to investigate the role of the genes identified in human patients by our linkage & mapping group. The initial program is financed for a period of three years and, if successful, the candidate will then be able to develop his/her own group.</p>


<p>The candidate should have good experience with zebrafish and developmental studies. Strong ties with other zebrafish groups are an advantage.</p>

<p>IRO, a research institute affiliated to the University of Lausanne, is located in Sion, in the center of the Swiss Alps, about 100 km from Lausanne. You can access our web page for further information (<a href="http://www.irovision.ch">http://www.irovision.ch/</a>).</p>

<p>JOB DESCRIPTION: POSTDOC IN MOLECULAR GENETICS/DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY AT THE MEDICAL FACULTY, UNIVERSITY OF TROMS&Oslash;, NORWAY</p>

<p>At the Medical Faculty, University of Troms&oslash;, there is a  post doc position open for 3 years in the field of molecular genetics/developmental biology. The position is a part of a collaboration between research groups at the Institute of Pharmacy and the Institute of Medical Biology, and it plays a central part in the establishment of  zebrafish as a model system. The project is a part of the research strategy of the Medical Faculty.</p>

<p>The involved research groups study the transcription factor Pax6 and the nuclear protein SPBP, in addition to the atypical protein kinase C isoforms lambda and zeta and their interaction partners. These are all important factors for transcriptional regulation and cell signalling, maybe best illustrated by their association with cancer and other diseases. To gain further information of the biological function of the gene products we study, their target genes and interaction partners, zebrafish will be used as a model-system. Knowledge about zebrafish/fish development (embryology, anatomy and physiology) and/or molecular genetic techniques such as immunohistochemistry and RNA in situ hybridisation is required.</p>

<p>To be considered for the position the candidate needs to have a PhD.</p>

<p>A post doc is paid according to the state salary scale, code1352.</p>

<p>A position is available to study the biology of the TRP ion channel
polycystin2 in zebrafish. The immediate goals of this project are to
characterize the phenotype of polycystin2 loss of function in various organs
in the developing zebrafish with a primary focus on the pronephric kidney.
This position will involve microinjection of antisense oligos, and
determination of outcomes using standard histology, in situ hybridization,
and analysis of electron micrographs. This study can also involve developing
new optical technology for physiological readouts of calcium ion activity in
living embryos. Other projects relating to the development and function of
the zebrafish pronephros may also be pursued depending on the interests and
motivation of the fellow.</p>

<p>A postdoctoral position is available in the Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine. Our lab uses zebrafish to explore the biology and genetics of growth/size control. For example, we have identified zebrafish mutants which demonstrate fin overgrowth. Growth of the wild type zebrafish fin is tightly regulated, thus dissecting the biology of growth control pathways through mutant analysis will provide insight into normal growth control checkpoints. For an example of this work, see Goldsmith et al., Dev Bio, 259(2):303-317.</p>

<p>We are also interested in the relationship between nutritional status and growth. Although growth of adult wild type fish is exquisitely sensitive to nutritional status, this nutrition checkpoint can be bypassed under certain conditions (e.g. fin regeneration). Mutant screens have just been initiated to help explore the role of nutrition in the overall hierarchy of pathways regulating growth.</p>
