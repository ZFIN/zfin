<p><center><strong>(Washington University School of Medicine)</strong></center></p><br>

<p>A postdoctoral position is available in the Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine. Our lab uses zebrafish to explore the biology and genetics of growth/size control. For example, we have identified zebrafish mutants which demonstrate fin overgrowth. Growth of the wild type zebrafish fin is tightly regulated, thus dissecting the biology of growth control pathways through mutant analysis will provide insight into normal growth control checkpoints. For an example of this work, see Goldsmith et al., Dev Bio, 259(2):303-317.</p>

<p>We are also interested in the relationship between nutritional status and growth. Although growth of adult wild type fish is exquisitely sensitive to nutritional status, this nutrition checkpoint can be bypassed under certain conditions (e.g. fin regeneration). Mutant screens have just been initiated to help explore the role of nutrition in the overall hierarchy of pathways regulating growth.</p>

<p>Washington University School of Medicine Department of Pediatrics is a vibrant research community. We are looking for individuals with molecular biology or genetics experience. Zebrafish experience would be helpful but it is not required.</p>

<p>2 Postdoctoral Positions<br>
Vascular Biology Program, Children's Hospital Boston</p>

<p>We are seeking two postdoctoral fellows to work on an NIH funded project starting in September, 2004.  We are a new group in the Program in Vascular Biology headed by Dr. Judah Folkman, at the Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School. We use genetic, chemical genetic and molecular approaches to dissect signaling pathways in the zebrafish, with the goal of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying angiogenesis in an intact vertebrate organism.</p>

<p>An example of our work is found in Chan et al., 2002, "Dissection of angiogenic signaling using a chemical genetic approach", Cancer Cell, vol.1: 257-267.  We have recently isolated a series of new angiogenic mutants from a novel genetic screen in heterozygous zebrafish embryos using a small molecule kinase inhibitor.  These mutants display vascular phenotypes as homozygous recessives.  Projects include characterization and positional cloning of these angiogenic mutants as well as development of transgenic lines.   This project is ideal for new graduates interested in using the zebrafish for cancer-relevant signal transduction studies.  Salary will be based on Children's Hospital guidelines.</p>  

<p>Qualifications:   Ph.D. training in molecular biology or genetics.  Zebrafish experience is preferred but training will also be provided.</p>
