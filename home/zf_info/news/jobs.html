<p>Generation of novel zebrafish knock-out and knock-in models for the study of angiogenesis.

<p>A postdoctoral position is available to apply zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) technology to generate zebrafish knock-out and knock-in models related to blood vessel development.  This position will provide a unique opportunity to exploit and further develop ZFN technology in zebrafish as part of an ongoing collaborative effort between the neighboring laboratories of Drs. Nathan Lawson and Scot Wolfe.  This effort will include the application of ZFNs to generate knock-in and conditional alleles and will afford the successful applicant with the opportunity to master selection systems used to generate and evaluate site-specific ZFNs.  The genetic models developed in the context of these studies will be used to address questions of interest relating to endothelial cell differentiation and angiogenesis.  Particular emphasis will be on the Vegf and Notch signaling pathways, as well as development of zebrafish models for congenital vascular disease.  For more information, see the following publications, or go to lawsonlab.umassmed.edu or labs.umassmed.edu/WolfeLab/index.html.

TWO POST-DOCTORAL POSITIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO STUDY SYNAPTIC FUNCTION IN THE VISUAL SYSTEM OF ZEBRAFISH

<p>1.  SYNAPTIC PROCESSING OF VISUAL INFORMATION IN VIVO INVESTIGATED BY MULTIPHOTON MICROSCOPY IN COMBINATION WITH FLUORESCENT REPORTER PROTEINS.   We have recently developed reporters for monitoring calcium influx and vesicle fusion in synaptic terminals and are using these to monitor synaptic activity in large populations of neurons within intact circuits.  We are particularly interested in the function of ribbon synapses in the retina, but also aim to investigate the retinal output received by neurons in the tectum.  The overall aim is to understand how these synapses transfer information contained within a visual stimulus.

<p>2.  THE MOLECULAR EVENTS INVOLVED IN EXOCYTOSIS AND ENDOCYTOSIS AT RIBBON SYNAPSES INVESTIGATED USING ISOLATED RETINAL NEURONS AND TOTAL INTERNAL REFLECTION FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY (TIRFM).  This technique allows the visualization of synaptic vesicles and fluorescent molecules within about 100 nm of the surface membrane.  We have generated fish that express fluorescent fusion proteins regulating vesicle behaviour at or near the active zone and are using these to monitor the vesicle cycle in real-time.   The basic aim is to better understand the processes that control the translocation and docking of vesicles before fusion, as well as the retrieval of vesicles after fusion

<p>Both positions are in the laboratory of Leon Lagnado in the Neurobiology Division at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge.  The projects use a combination of molecular biology, zebrafish genetics, advanced imaging methods and electrophysiology. Experience in at least one of these techniques would be required, together with the desire to learn one or more of the others.  A strong interest in the function of the nervous system is essential, and more specific interests in synapses, vision or zebrafish would be an advantage.  If you are interested please contact Leon  by e-mail with your CV and the names of two referees (<a href="mailto:LL1@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk">LL1@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk</a>).  Further information can be obtained by contacting Leon directly and from our website (<a href="http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/groups/LL/index.html">http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/groups/LL/index.html</a>).  Both positions are funded by the Wellcome Trust for a period up to five years.

<center><strong>(University of Leuven)</strong></center><br>
<p>TREAT-OA (European Framework Program 7) represents a large-scale collaborative, integrated, trans-disciplinary project utilizing a resource of 28,000 OA phenotyped subjects with available genome-wide association scan data as well as leading basic science laboratories and technologies. The key scientific objectives of TREAT-OA are:

<p>- to identify genes and biochemical markers consistently associated with risk and progression of OA

<p>- define their function in the molecular pathways involved in disease aetiology

<p>- develop in vivo models by the use of transgenic animal laboratory OA model systems.

<p>Within this project we are currently looking for a post-doctoral fellow to join our research team focusing on the functional studies (item 2). Specifically, the work will involve identification and cloning and in situ studies of zebrafish orthologues of human disease genes. Next, gain and loss of function studies in the fish will be carried out to identify signaling pathways associated with those genes. Finally, generation of stable mutant fish lines and phenotypic analysis will be carried out on selected genes. The tools to perform this research project consist of advanced molecular embryology using zebrafish model, histology and analysis of gene expression by in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence and quantitative PCR.

<p>A successful candidate will have a prior training in the zebrafish developmental biology. Knowledge of the early fish development as well as advanced molecular biology would be an advantage. The candidate should be able to work independently in a team-oriented project. Additionally the candidate must be fluent in spoken and written English. The starting date for the project is October 2008 and the project duration is 3 years.

<p>For further information, please contact Prof. Frank Luyten (<a href="mailto:frank.luyten@uz.kuleuven.be">frank.luyten@uz.kuleuven.be</a>) or Prof. Przemko Tylzanowski (<a href="mailto:przemko@med.kuleuven.be">przemko@med.kuleuven.be</a>). To apply, please send a motivation letter with names and contact coordinates (email and/or phone) of two referees to the above email addresses.
