Postdoctoral Research Positions in Neuronal Regeneration

<p>Department of Biological Sciences and Center for Zebrafish Research
University of Notre Dame

<p>Two open postdoctoral research positions are available at any time in the next 6 months to study regeneration of the light-damaged zebrafish retina (Vihtelic and Hyde (2000) J. Neurobiol. 44: 289-307). We are interested in identifying molecular signals that induce and regulate the regeneration response and the signals that guide the neuronal progenitor cells only to the damaged retinal layer. We use a variety of techniques to approach these questions, including gene microarrays to identify candidate genes involved at specific stages of regeneration (Kassen et al. (2007) Dev. Neurobiol. 67: 1009-1031) and electroporation of morpholinos to conditionally knockdown specific proteins in the regenerating adult retina to test the functional significance of candidate proteins (Thummel et al. (2008) Dev. Neurobiol. 68: 392-408). 

<p>We are looking for talented individuals who are experienced in a wide variety of fields. More experienced individuals may be considered to be hired at the non-tenure track Research Assistant Professor level.

<p>A fully funded postdoctoral position is available to study one of two projects related to the formation of the vertebrate head skeleton. The first project, which is funded by a grant from the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), uses both zebrafish and human stem cell models to investigate the origin of head skeletal precursors. Specifically, we plan to use new transgenic tools to address the role of chromatin remodeling in jaw regeneration in zebrafish and early lineage decisions in human ES cells. The second project, funded by an NIH R01 grant, focuses on how local signaling centers control head skeletal patterning in zebrafish. To do so, we plan to use a UAS/Gal4 library to misexpress growth factors in specific domains, followed by time-lapse imaging to assess the behavioral consequences on skeletal precursors.
 
<p>Applicants should have a background in stem cell or developmental biology.

 The Notch signaling pathway plays a central part in controlling both the
spatial pattern and the timing of differentiation in animal tissues. We are
seeking to recruit a postdoctoral research fellow - or possibly two - to
work on this topic, using zebrafish as model organism. Projects are

(A) the somite segmentation clock and quantitative analysis of Notch
signalling dynamics; (B) Notch and Wnt signalling in the gut stem-cell
system, and perhaps elsewhere, using a new technique for in-vivo clonal
analysis of gene function that we have recently developed.
 
<p>Candidates skilled in molecular biology, developmental biology, imaging,
and/or (for Project A) mathematical modelling are encouraged to apply; but
it is not necessary to have experience in all these areas. The main
requirement is enthusiasm for the topic and the approach.

<p>
Post-doctoral position available in the laboratory of Dr. Sudipto Roy, Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore

<p>In our laboratory at the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (IMCB) in Singapore, we are interested in understanding the genetic basis of vertebrate development. For this, we are using the zebrafish embryo as it is uniquely amenable to many kinds of experimental manipulations. To highlight some of our achievements, we have discovered a gene called blimp1 that is required for the specification of a distinct lineage of muscle cells in the zebrafish embryo. These muscle cells, called the slow-twitch muscle cells, are present in all vertebrates and allow sustained muscular activity through aerobic metabolism. Our studies have shown that blimp1 is not just necessary for slow muscle formation, but its activity is also sufficient for inducing nave muscle cells to adopt the slow muscle fiber fate. We have also identified the mechanism by which certain cells are able to differentiate specialized organelles called cilia. For example, in our own bodies, cells of the respiratory tract, the lining of the brain cavities and the spinal cord bear cilia. These cilia are motile and their movement is essential for the transport of fluid - like mucus in the respiratory tract and cerebrospinal fluid in the central nervous system. Our studies have shown that a transcription factor called Foxj1 is essential for controlling the expression of genes that are required to build the cilia. Besides normal development, we are also interested in understanding the processes by which certain tissues are able to regenerate themselves in response to injury. In mammals, regenerative capacity is quite limited. By contrast, lower vertebrates like the zebrafish can regenerate many structures like the heart, retina, fins as well as the spinal cord. Using regeneration of the zebrafish tail fin as a paradigm, we are attempting to discover the genes that are important for the initiation and progression of the regenerative process. We believe that our findings may have implications for regenerative medicine in the treatment of human diseases and injuries.
