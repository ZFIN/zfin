Two to three positions, each focused a different area, are available: Computer Vision, Programming for the Web Site, and Genetic Model Systems.   Our project is based on the infrastructure of the web-based Zebrafish Atlas, <a href="http://www.zfatlas.psu.edu/">www.zfatlas.psu.edu</a>, the Cheng lab's broad disciplinary base in zebrafish, mouse, and human molecular genetics, and involves whole-animal 3D imaging at cell resolutions, in collaboration with scientists at the University of Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory's Advanced Photon Source, and with zebrafish investigators world-wide.  Completion of a project with five already-mapped zebrafish mutants is available for candidates with experience in model systems. Also potentially available, particularly to MD fellows, is the possibility of a project with human tissues.

<p>Two types of expertise are being hired into this position: 3D Image Visualization and Analysis and studying the consequences of mutation on a whole-body level at cell resolution.

<p>The ideal candidate will be:
<br>1) highly motivated and energetic
<br>2) be creative in finding innovative solutions to important and difficult problems
<br>3) have an interest in biological imaging and 3D imaging,

Postdoctoral position to study retinal development
at the University of Pittsburgh
 
 
<p>A postdoctoral position is available to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms of cellular pattern formation in the zebrafish retina. The vertebrate retina develops from a single sheet of polarized neuroepithelial cells, which later differentiate and reorganize into a multilayered structure. Each retinal layer is composed of specific cell classes and executes distinct functions. It is largely unknown how this specific cellular pattern is established and maintained during retinal development.  Our research concerns several disciplines: Developmental Biology, Genetics, Molecular Biology, Cell Biology, and Biochemistry. Candidates with a Ph.D. degree in related fields are encouraged to apply for the position. Please send your cover letter and CV to

<center><strong>(University of Michigan)</strong></center><br>

<p>
The Kuwada lab seeks a postdoc to analyze the function of a gene that is required for formation of the nerve/muscle synapse in zebrafish. We have identified a zebrafish mutation in a gene that regulates the development of the neuromuscular junction. The gene encodes a muscle receptor for a signaling molecule secreted by the terminals of motor neurons that is necessary for the accumulation of neurotransmitter receptors at the neuromuscular junction. The project includes the generation of transgenic zebrafish in which various mutated versions of this gene are expressed by mutant muscles in order to assay how different domains of the receptor contribute to synapse formation. Experience with molecular biology, immunocytochemistry and biochemistry are highly desired for this project. The position is available now and is funded by a NIH grant. Please contact John Kuwada (<a href="mailto:kuwada@umich.edu">kuwada@umich.edu</a>) for more information.

A new state of the art research facility, which includes a drug screening laboratory at the Sheffield Institute for Translational Neurosciences (SITraN) is scheduled for completion in summer 2010.  The MRC Centre for Developmental and Biomedical Genetics (refurbished 2006) is fully equipped for work with zebrafish, and has recently expanded its capacity to over 23,000 litres capable of holding approximately 80,000 fish. Thus it is one of the largest zebrafish research facilities in the Europe.  The UK Universities Research Assessment Exercise (RAE-2007) panel ranked the Neurology unit headed by Prof. Shaw as among the top-8 in UK. The MRC Centre with whom we have an ongoing collaboration is a leader in utilizing zebrafish in biomedical research. The overall goal of both centres is to translate basic science into new therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. 

<p>The laboratory of Dr. Tennore Ramesh and Prof. Pamela Shaw at the Department of Neurosciences are currently offering a PhD studentship that will provide generous stipend for 3 years.  The student will get an opportunity to conduct research in the new state of the art research facility at SiTraN and work on developing and utilizing zebrafish models of MND in target and drug discovery.  Current projects in the Ramesh laboratory include (1) Developing zebrafish models of motor neuron disease (MND) (2) Study neurodegeneration and regeneration in a sod1 zebrafish model of MND. 3) Identify cellular changes/phenotypes in early embryonic stages to develop new tools for HT genetic and pharmacological screens.   

<p>Interested candidate should have a strong background in neuroscience and practical experiences in molecular biology and microscopy.  Interested students who meet the qualifications should contact Dr. Ramesh (<a href="mailto:t.ramesh@sheffield.ac.uk">t.ramesh@sheffield.ac.uk</a>).  The due date for applications is July 15th, 2010

<center><strong>(Stanford University, Stanford, CA)</strong></center><br>

<p>
We are seeking to fill a postdoctoral position with a project focus on zebrafish development in the Riedel-Kruse Lab, Bioengineering Department, Stanford. 

<p>We are fascinated by the emergent dynamics of biological systems - with one focus of our lab on understanding how genetic networks orchestrate the dynamics and mechanics of developing embryos. We take a physics approach by iterating between mathematical models and quantitative experiments. Zebrafish is particularly amenable to this approach due to its fast and external development, optical transparency, large number of eggs in a clutch needed for statistics, and the variety of genetic tools available. Our work will result in new quantitative methods to monitor and perturb these genetic networks, and we aim for conceptually deeper insights into key developmental principles such as the utility of entrained genetic oscillators and mechanical forces / motors for the patterning of a growing tissue. Please see Riedel-Kruse, I.H., Muller, C., and Oates, A.C.; Synchrony dynamics during initiation, failure and rescue of the segmentation clock. Science (2007) 317: 1911; or visit our website at <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/riedel-kruse/">http://www.stanford.edu/group/riedel-kruse/</a>

<p>This position offers the interdisciplinary advantages of Stanford in general, and the Bioengineering and Developmental Biology departments, in particular. Multiple groups working on Zebrafish provide a vibrant and interactive community; the embedding of our lab in the Bioengineering Department facilitates collaborations on many emerging technologies.

<p>You should be highly motivated and technically accomplished as documented by an exceptional publication record. The ideal candidate will have demonstrated experience with vertebrate developmental model systems and a strong background in molecular biology. Prior experience with zebrafish is desired, but not essential. Experience with computational and theoretical approaches would be a plus, but are not explicitly required - and this position particularly offers the opportunity to develop and strengthen this skill set within our interdisciplinary environment. Most of all, we value curiosity, creativity, and a pleasant personality.

<p>Please email CV incl. a list of relevant publications to the contact information below. Applicants accepted for initial consideration will be subsequently contacted for letters of reference. Please also mention whether you plan to travel to the bay area in the near future, or plan to attend relevant meetings (especially the Zebrafish meeting in Madison, June 16th-20th).

<p>The group is investigating the role of epigenetic mechanisms in cancer progression using a set of zebrafish cancer models that we have generated and characterized.
The successful applicant will conduct research in the development of statistical methods, clustering and computational analysis to map genomics and expression data while critically reviewing currently available methods. Approaches to model these biological events are also welcome. The data will be provided by a very active team composed of a biochemist, a cell biologists and a developmental biologist. We are producing a large set of data on the mutational, transcriptional and post-translational profile of tumors during their progression and would like to be able to use this data in a comparative effort to generate predictive markers and elucidate the mechanisms of oncogenic transformation. The Campus has an increasing number of computational biologists and is launching a PhD program in computational biology. Thus, the position offers a unique opportunity for a researcher to interact with experts in a highly interdisciplinary environment and the possibility to team up with other computational biologists working at the Campus on quantitative data obtained by state-of-the art technologies.
<p>Enthusiastic candidates with background in the field of computational analysis for quantitative gene expression data are strongly encouraged to apply.

<p>
Multiple postdoctoral positions are currently open in the Lawson Laboratory in the Program in Gene Function and Expression, University of Massachusetts Medical School.

<p>Generation of novel zebrafish gene knock-out models for the study of angiogenesis.
A postdoctoral position is available to apply zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) technology to generate zebrafish knock-out models related to blood vessel development. This position will provide a unique opportunity to exploit and further develop ZFN technology in zebrafish as part of an ongoing collaborative effort between the neighboring laboratories of Drs. Nathan Lawson and Scot Wolfe. This effort will provide the successful applicant with the opportunity to master modular- and selection-based systems used to generate and evaluate site-specific ZFNs. The genetic models developed in the context of these studies will be used to address questions of interest relating to endothelial cell differentiation and angiogenesis. Particular emphasis will be on the application of ZFNs in the context of a reverse genetic screen to interrogate novel regulators of vascular development, as well as development of zebrafish models for vascular disease.


<p>Studying blood vessel formation and function using the zebrafish as a model system.
A postdoctoral position is available to utilize the zebrafish as a model system to study blood vessel development. Areas of particular interest include the following: transcriptional regulatory networks required for endothelial specification and blood vessel identity, the role of Notch signaling during vascular development, how mechanosensory inputs are integrated with developmental signaling pathways during blood vessel morphogenesis, and the role of microRNAs in vascular development. We take full advantage of the many benefits of the zebrafish model including the application of in vivo imaging by 2-photon microscopy, genetic manipulation through the use of zinc finger nucleases, and development of transgenic sensor lines for visualizing signaling outputs in vivo.
