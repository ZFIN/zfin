<p>A postdoctoral position is available in the
Lawson laboratory at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Our work
focuses on the signals that govern blood vessel formation during embryonic
development in the zebrafish. We are especially interested in the pathways that
drive artery and vein differentiation (see Lawson and Weinstein, <i>Nat Rev
Genet</i> 3:674; Lawson et al., <i>Development</i>, 128:3675; and Lawson et al.,
<i>Dev Cell</i> 3:127). Current projects in the lab include performing genetic
screens using blood vessel specific transgenic zebrafish lines to identify
regulators of artery development (see Lawson et al. <i>Dev Biol</i> 248:307 and
Lawson et al. <i>Genes Dev</i> 17:1346). Previous experience with zebrafish
would be ideal, but is not required. Extensive molecular biology experience is
absolutely essential. If you are interested, please send or email your CV and

<HR>

  

   <p>The University of Manitoba's Department of
   Zoology invites applications for a tenure-track Assistant Professor position
   in Animal Physiology. We seek to add a colleague who will develop a strong
   independent research program in Molecular, Cellular or Organismal Physiology
   and teach in our undergraduate and graduate programs. There is flexibility in
   the specific physiology research area, however research interest and strength
   in vertebrate or invertebrate endocrinology and/or neurobiology would be an
   asset and complement the current physiological expertise in the department.
   It is expected the successful applicant will complement the current faculty
   and help to maintain this area as one of the cornerstones in a broadly based
   integrative Zoology department. Current research interests of our faculty
   range from the molecular to ecosystem levels and include physiological,
   ecological, evolutionary and systematic, organismal, cellular and
   developmental biology areas.</p>
   <p>Applicants must possess a PhD, preferably have
   post-doctoral experience, with evidence of strong research potential in an
   area of physiology. The successful applicant will be expected to establish an
   independent, externally-funded research program, supervise graduate students,
   teach in our undergraduate and graduate programs, and fulfill some
   committee/administrative responsibilities. New faculty are initially given a
   reduced teaching load. The salary is commensurate with qualifications and
   experience. Startup support to help establish a research program is
   available. Additional external funding opportunities such as Canada
   Foundation for Innovation (CFI) may be available. The appointment will begin
   July 1, 2004&nbsp; or soon thereafter.</p>
   <p>The successful applicant will join a collegial
   research-oriented department that offers graduate and undergraduate education
   covering a wide spectrum of areas in Zoology. The Department has a variety of
   research support facilities that include: aquatic (including transgenic
   containment) and terrestrial animal holding facilities, field stations,
   preparative and analytical equipment, and an electron microscope unit. There
   are also opportunities for research interaction on campus with various
   university biological and biomedical departments, as well as with various
   Provincial and Federal Government Departments and laboratories that are
   engaged in physiological research and possibly industry.</p>
   <p>Winnipeg is an affordable, cosmopolitan city
   with a rich ethnic diversity, an active arts community and a wide array of
   outstanding restaurants.&nbsp; Outdoor activities and nature are close at

<p>Highly motivated individuals are invited to apply
for a post-doctoral scientist appointment in the Division of Matrix Biology (MBB)
at the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden. Our research group is interested
in the developmental signals that control growth and differentiation during
vertebrate kidney organogenesis. Because the nephron is the functional unit of
the kidney and the pathophysiological site of human kidney diseases, including
glomerular pathologies, we have concentrated our research efforts on identifying
the molecular/genetic regulation of nephron formation. Topics of investigation
include nephron segmentation, tubulogenesis, and glomerular morphogenesis. Our
lab is using the zebrafish embryonic kidney or pronephros as a model system for
investigating kidney organogenesis due to several experimental advantages
including anatomical simplicity, rapid development, and the ease plus detail of
visualization using molecular probes. The zebrafish pronephros system is
amenable to genetic analysis, and mutants have been informative for identifying
important genes and cellular interactions during pronephric organogenesis
(Development, 125, pp. 4655-67, 1998; Dev Gen., 24, pp. 220-29, 1999; Dev. Biol.
222, pp. 147-57, 2000). The zebrafish mutant <i>no isthmus</i> (<i>noi</i>)
contains a mutation in the transcription factor Pax2.1 and is associated with
pleiotrophic defects including those affecting pronephric development. During
pronephric organogenesis, pronephric tubules do not form in noi mutants due to
problems in patterning of the nephric primordium (Development, 127, pp. 2089-98,
2000). We are using the <i>noi </i>mutant as an entrance point into
investigating the genetic pathways that cooperate with Pax2.1 to regulate
nephron segmentation and renal tubular differentiation. In related projects, we
are using the zebrafish pronephric system to study the gene function in
glomerular maturation and function. Experimental approaches involve genetic
screens, antisense morpholino technology, microarrays, and transgenesis.
Research will be conducted in the new Karolinska Institutet Zebrafish Facility
and the Division of Matrix Biology, both located in the Scheelelaboratoriet on
the Karolinska Institutet (Solna) campus. Located close to the Stockholm city
center, the Karolinska Institutet is one of Europes largest medical
universities and has strong and dynamic research programs in th e basic and
clinical sciences. KI provides an international environment encouraging
collaboration and scientific interaction. Interested applicants should have an
interest in kidney organogenesis and prior research experience in molecular and
developmental biology.&nbsp;</p>
