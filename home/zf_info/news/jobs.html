<p><center><strong>(Pfizer Global R&D in Groton, CT)</strong></center></p><br>
<p>Available April 2008:  a position for a postdoctoral fellow in our developmental toxicology lab at Pfizer Global R&D in Groton, CT to pursue two projects: 1) Use non-rodent models to help determine which protein targets might be druggable, and which ones have prohibitive developmental toxicity. Thus, this project would use selective gene knock-down in Zebrafish to define the line between acceptably and unacceptably-reduced protein activity.  This would parallel similar activities in mice starting in the lab, so we’re expecting some complementarity between the two programs, and that each can learn from the other.  2) We want to see if teratogens and non-teratogens produce different profiles in a variety of signaling pathways in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC’s).  Thus, of the two projects, one provides higher risk and greater reward, and the other should be as close to a guaranteed publication as is reasonable to expect.  Please contact us for a more complete description of these projects.

<p>We are a lab of 8 morphologic, biochemical, and molecular developmental toxicologists working in world-class labs equipped with robotics and the latest in transfection technology. We have industry-leading mouse ESC expertise, and are quickly developing Zebrafish experience.  You will be working in a breathtaking array of technologies, with smart and highly motivated colleagues with high expectations of you and us, expectations and support to publish (y)our results, and a front-row seat in the industrial environment. We are looking for someone with Zebrafish or stem cell experience and a solid understanding of the appropriate techniques in molecular biology.

<p>Approx. $50,000/yr, on a 1 yr contract, renewable up to 3 yrs total, plus full benefits.  This research campus is in southeastern CT.    Please contact Bob Chapin at <a href="mailto:robert.e.chapin@pfizer.com">robert.e.chapin@pfizer.com</a> (860-441-0571) for further details. </p>

TWO POST-DOCTORAL POSITIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO STUDY SYNAPTIC FUNCTION IN THE VISUAL SYSTEM OF ZEBRAFISH

<p>1.  SYNAPTIC PROCESSING OF VISUAL INFORMATION IN VIVO INVESTIGATED BY MULTIPHOTON MICROSCOPY IN COMBINATION WITH FLUORESCENT REPORTER PROTEINS.   We have recently developed reporters for monitoring calcium influx and vesicle fusion in synaptic terminals and are using these to monitor synaptic activity in large populations of neurons within intact circuits.  We are particularly interested in the function of ribbon synapses in the retina, but also aim to investigate the retinal output received by neurons in the tectum.  The overall aim is to understand how these synapses transfer information contained within a visual stimulus.

<p>2.  THE MOLECULAR EVENTS INVOLVED IN EXOCYTOSIS AND ENDOCYTOSIS AT RIBBON SYNAPSES INVESTIGATED USING ISOLATED RETINAL NEURONS AND TOTAL INTERNAL REFLECTION FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY (TIRFM).  This technique allows the visualization of synaptic vesicles and fluorescent molecules within about 100 nm of the surface membrane.  We have generated fish that express fluorescent fusion proteins regulating vesicle behaviour at or near the active zone and are using these to monitor the vesicle cycle in real-time.   The basic aim is to better understand the processes that control the translocation and docking of vesicles before fusion, as well as the retrieval of vesicles after fusion

<p>Both positions are in the laboratory of Leon Lagnado in the Neurobiology Division at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge.  The projects use a combination of molecular biology, zebrafish genetics, advanced imaging methods and electrophysiology. Experience in at least one of these techniques would be required, together with the desire to learn one or more of the others.  A strong interest in the function of the nervous system is essential, and more specific interests in synapses, vision or zebrafish would be an advantage.  If you are interested please contact Leon  by e-mail with your CV and the names of two referees (<a href="mailto:LL1@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk">LL1@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk</a>).  Further information can be obtained by contacting Leon directly and from our website (<a href="http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/groups/LL/index.html">http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/groups/LL/index.html</a>).

<p>TREAT-OA (European Framework Program 7) represents a large-scale collaborative, integrated, trans-disciplinary project utilizing a resource of 28,000 OA phenotyped subjects with available genome-wide association scan data as well as leading basic science laboratories and technologies. The key scientific objectives of TREAT-OA are:

<p>- to identify genes and biochemical markers consistently associated with risk and progression of OA

<p>- define their function in the molecular pathways involved in disease aetiology

<p>- develop in vivo models by the use of transgenic animal laboratory OA model systems.

<p>Within this project we are currently looking for a post-doctoral fellow to join our research team focusing on the functional studies (item 2). Specifically, the work will involve identification and cloning and in situ studies of zebrafish orthologues of human disease genes. Next, gain and loss of function studies in the fish will be carried out to identify signaling pathways associated with those genes. Finally, generation of stable mutant fish lines and phenotypic analysis will be carried out on selected genes. The tools to perform this research project consist of advanced molecular embryology using zebrafish model, histology and analysis of gene expression by in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence and quantitative PCR.

<p>A successful candidate will have a prior training in the zebrafish developmental biology. Knowledge of the early fish development as well as advanced molecular biology would be an advantage. The candidate should be able to work independently in a team-oriented project. Additionally the candidate must be fluent in spoken and written English. The starting date for the project is October 2008 and the project duration is 3 years.

<p><center><strong>(Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, GA)</strong></center></p><br>
<p>A post-graduate level position (Masters or PhD) is available immediately at the Medical College of Georgia to study neural circuit formation, function, and regeneration in zebrafish. Live imaging techniques are used provide new insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying how circuits form (see Mumm J.S. et al., 2006). Inducible targeted cellular ablation techniques (see, Curado S. et al., 2007) are being applied to study the function of specific neuronal subtypes and subcircuits. Because zebrafish have an innate capacity for regeneration, which extends even to the nervous system, targeted ablation can combined with large-scale genetic & chemical screens to develop degenerative disease modes and to identify factors which promote adult stem cell-based regenerative programs. This system can be applied to a multitude of cell/tissue types and thus provides an excellent opportunity for someone seeking to develop an independent regenerative research program. 

<p>Interested candidates must have a post-graduate degree in the biological sciences and expertise in molecular biology and/or genetics. Candidates with prior experience using zebrafish as a model system are preferred.
