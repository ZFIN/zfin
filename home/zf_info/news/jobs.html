<HR>

<p>The Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics (CBG) in Dresden is
seeking outstanding candidates for an independent Group Leader in Biophysics.</p>

<p>Research at the institute focuses on the molecular mechanisms underlying the
structure and organization of cells and tissues. Further information about our
research can be found on our web site (<a href="http://www.mpi-cbg.de">http://www.mpi-cbg.de</a>)</p>

<p>In this search we are looking for applicants who are taking biophysical approaches to cellular or
developmental biology. We especially welcome applications from candidates
working on mechanical aspects of the cytoskeleton, the extracellular matrix or
membranes.</p>

<p>A strong, interactive biophysics community has recently been
established in Dresden, and the institute offers an outstanding environment to study
cell biology in model organisms. PhD students are available through a thriving
International Max Planck Research School run in collaboration with the Technical
University of Dresden. The institute will provide the successful candidates with a
fully-equipped laboratory, support for a postdoctoral fellow, a predoctoral student
and a technician, and adequate funds for consumables. The initial group leader
contracts are for 5 years, renewable to 9 years, at the BAT Ia scale.</p>

<p>Applications containing a CV, publication list and research plan should be submitted
to Joe Howard at the address below before the extended deadline of <font color="#FF0000">October 20, 2004</font>.
 Three letters of recommendation should be sent separately by the application
deadline. CBG actively encourages female applicants.

<p>One group, which will be located at the MPI-PKS, will focus on theory. The
second group, which will be affiliated with both Institutes, will combine
theoretical and experimental research activities. We especially welcome
applications from candidates working on the cytoskeleton, the organization
and dynamics of cells, cell signaling and gene regulation.</p>
The two groups will promote and further strengthen collaborations between
the Institutes. Research at the MPI-PKS includes theoretical approaches to
molecular and cellular biophysics (see <a href="http://www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de">http://www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de</a>).
Research at MPI-CBG focuses on the molecular mechanisms underlying the
structure and organization of cells (see <a href="http://www.mpi-cbg.de">http://www.mpi-cbg.de</a>).</p>

<p>The strong interactive community at the interface of physics and biology that has

environment.
We offer positions for 5 years with BAT Ia salary. Funds are available for
postdoctoral fellows and a technician. PhD students can also be recruited.
We will provide office and laboratory space and adequate funds for
equipment and consumables.</p>

<HR>

<p>A postdoctoral position is available in the Department of Neurosciences at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation to investigate myelination in zebrafish, with a particular focus on identifying new mutations that may impact oligodendrocyte development and myelination.  This group has developed zebrafish expressing green fluorescent protein in oligodendrocytes.  The future project will use these zebrafish to screen for mutants that have altered oligodendrocyte morphology and development.  Subsequent identification of the mutant genes will be undertaken.</p>
<p>A Ph.D. in neuroscience, molecular biology or genetics is required. Experience in zebrafish developmental biology/mutagenesis, transgenic/gene promoter methodologies and imaging would be particularly desirable, along with exposure to developmental neuroscience and/or glial biology.  Interested applicants should submit a letter of interest with a curriculum vitae and arrange for three letters of recommendation to be sent to:</p>
