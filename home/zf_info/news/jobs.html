<p><b>Functional analysis of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase family in zebrafish</b></p>
<p>Dr. Jeroen den Hertog, at the Hubrecht Laboratory, has a position available for a
PhD student (m/f)</p>

<p>This is a multidisciplinary project within a dynamic research group working on signaling mediated by the protein-tyrosine phosphatase family. Protein phosphorylation on tyrosine residues is one of the most important cell signaling mechanisms, and is regulated by two families of enzymes with antagonistic activity, the protein-tyrosine kinases and the protein-tyrosine phosphatases. The goal of this project is to identify protein-tyrosine phosphatases that have essential roles in early zebrafish development by systematic knock down of each protein-tyrosine phosphatase. Emphasis will be placed on analysis of morphological defects and on defects in cell movement during gastrulation. The ultimate goal is to establish the molecular basis of the role of protein-tyrosine phosphatases in development. The candidate will use a range of techniques, including molecular biology, developmental biology, biochemistry and bioinformatics that are available within our research groups and he/she will write a thesis in order to obtain his/her PhD.</p>


<p>The Hubrecht Laboratory, Netherlands Institute for Developmental Biology of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, is a research institute comprising 15 research groups which focus on a wide variety of topics concerning developmental genetics and disease. The Institute provides a highly interactive research environment with excellent central research facilities and is directed by Prof. Ronald Plasterk and Prof. Hans Clevers. The Institute has close connections with Utrecht University and plays a central role in the Utrecht Graduate School for Developmental Biology in which the Hubrecht PhD students participate.</p>

<p>This position is funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), Research Council for Earth and Life Sciences (ALW).</p>

<p>Applicants should have a university degree (Drs./MSc) in biology, biochemistry or biomedical sciences. A strong background in molecular biology, developmental biology or biochemistry is preferred.</p>

<p>This position is funded for 4 years according to the CAO-Nederlandse Universiteiten (CAO-NU): ? 1,867 in the first year, increasing to ? 2,394 in the fourth year, excluding 8% holiday pay and a year-end bonus. We offer an extensive package of fringe benefits.</p>

These questions will be addressed in zebrafish embryonic and larval mutants that display ectopically activated or loss-of-function Wnt/&beta;-catenin signaling as well as in compound mutants. While a number of mutants are already available, additional mutants will be generated using target-selected gene inactivation technology. The role of each of the mutated genes will be studied by marker-gene expression, differentiation-specific antibodies and proliferation and apoptosis markers. To define cell autonomous versus non-autonomous function of the mutations, cell grafting in embryos will be carried out. Identification of Wnt/&beta;-catenin target genes involved in brain development will be studied by gene expression profiling (cDNA-based micro arrays) in different mutants.</p>

<p><b>Project financing:</b>  NWO-ALW</p>

<p><b>Requirements:</b>  We seek a creative, strongly motivated and hardworking PhD student (OIO) with interest in vertebrate nervous system development. The successful candidate has a background in (zebrafish) embryology, molecular biology, genomics, genetics (or any combination of these).</p>

<p><b>Starting date:</b>  as soon as possible</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b>  4 years </p>

<p><b>PhD position at the NKI</b></p>
<p>The role of LKB1 in tissue morphogenesis and cancer in zebrafish.</p>

<p>The serine-threonine  kinase LKB1 is a tumor suppressor in humans. Mutations in LKB1 lead to a gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyposis disorder with increased cancer predisposition, through a molecular mechanism that is not well understood. LKB1 has recently been shown to regulate polarity of human intestinal cells; its invertebrate homologues also function in cell polarity. Cell polarization has an important role in tissue morphogenesis and loss of cell polarity is an essential feature of neoplastic growth and metastasis. We have generated Lkb1-deficient zebrafish as a model to test the hypothesis that loss of LKB1 function may cause neoplastic transformation through disruption of epithelial polarization in a vertebrate organism.</p>

<p>The zebrafish provides a powerful animal model for genetic analysis of vertebrate embryogenesis, organ development and disease. Zebrafish have a short generation time (3 months), large progeny size (females typically lay 200 eggs at a time), the embryos develop outside the mother and are transparent. These characteristics make zebrafish an ideal system for dissecting developmental pathways and cellular mechanisms. The application of transgenesis, gene function knock-down by morpholino-modified antisense oligomers and the recent development of target selected mutational inactivation of genes, have provided a complete and powerful toolkit for genetic manipulation of zebrafish.</p>

<p>The project involves the study the cell polarization mechanisms during tissue morphogenesis and cancer employing Lkb1-deficient zebrafish. Analysis of cell-shape changes and cell behavior <i>in vivo</i>, will also be carried out.</p>

<p>Applications are invited for a postdoctoral position to join Prof. Roger Patient's group studying molecular programming of blood stem cells. The post-holder will be expected to work on the molecular basis of blood stem cell and vascular development in zebrafish, to liaise with others in the Group studying this in the amphibian, Xenopus, and also with colleagues in the Unit studying mammalian systems and human blood diseases. Approaches will involve precise expression profiling of transcriptional factors and embryonic signalling molecules and their receptors, perturbation of their functions and identification of cis-regulatory elements within target genes in order to determine the genetic regulatory networks programming the cells.</p>
 
<p>The successful candidate will be an experienced researcher with a good knowledge of molecular developmental biology who can work independently and supervise less experienced colleagues.  Experience of working with zebrafish as a genetic model system would be desirable.</p>
