<p>Two open postdoctoral research positions are available at any time in the next 6 months to study regeneration of the light-damaged zebrafish retina (Vihtelic and Hyde (2000) J. Neurobiol. 44: 289-307). We are interested in identifying molecular signals that induce and regulate the regeneration response and the signals that guide the neuronal progenitor cells only to the damaged retinal layer. We use a variety of techniques to approach these questions, including gene microarrays to identify candidate genes involved at specific stages of regeneration (Kassen et al. (2007) Dev. Neurobiol. 67: 1009-1031) and electroporation of morpholinos to conditionally knockdown specific proteins in the regenerating adult retina to test the functional significance of candidate proteins (Thummel et al. (2008) Dev. Neurobiol. 68: 392-408). 

<p>We are looking for talented individuals who are experienced in a wide variety of fields. More experienced individuals may be considered to be hired at the non-tenure track Research Assistant Professor level. The positions are funded by both NIH grants and a large annual budget provided by the University. Opportunities also exist for the successful candidate to gain some teaching experience, if desired. 

<p>Interested candidates should Email a cv and description of their previous research experience to Dr. David Hyde (<a href="mailto:dhyde@nd.edu">dhyde@nd.edu</a>). Candidates should also arrange three letters of recommendation to be Emailed directly to David Hyde.

<p>
Graduate research assistantship (Ph.D.) to work on the development and evolution of skeletal adaptations in Antarctic icefish.

<p>Albertson Lab, Department of Biology, Syracuse University

<p>The highly successful evolutionary radiation of Antarctic notothenioid fish involved several structural changes in the musculoskeletal system to accommodate a pelagic lifestyle. These include the evolution of bone loss to increase buoyancy, and craniofacial adaptations to accommodate shits in diet and foraging strategies. Up to four years of funding (via research assistantship) are available to study the genetic and developmental mechanisms that underlie these skeletal adaptations.

<p>The successful applicant will interact with other students in the lab (undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral) participating in a variety of projects using a number of systems including zebrafish, African cichlids and Antarctic icefish.  The approach of the lab is to integrate studies in a laboratory model (i.e., zebrafish) and natural populations (i.e., cichlids) to understand the evolution of animal form and function. Methods of study include comparative embryology, developmental and molecular genetics, quantitative genetics, and morphometric shape analysis.

<p>For more information about ongoing projects in the lab please visit my website at <a href="http://albertsonlab.syr.edu/research.html">http://albertsonlab.syr.edu/research.html</a>.

<p>
Postdoctoral Position in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, University of Southern California

<p>A fully funded postdoctoral position is available to study one of two projects related to the formation of the vertebrate head skeleton. The first project, which is funded by a grant from the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), uses both zebrafish and human stem cell models to investigate the origin of head skeletal precursors. Specifically, we plan to use new transgenic tools to address the role of chromatin remodeling in jaw regeneration in zebrafish and early lineage decisions in human ES cells. The second project, funded by an NIH R01 grant, focuses on how local signaling centers control head skeletal patterning in zebrafish. To do so, we plan to use a UAS/Gal4 library to misexpress growth factors in specific domains, followed by time-lapse imaging to assess the behavioral consequences on skeletal precursors.
 
<p>Applicants should have a background in stem cell or developmental biology. Salary support will be at current NIH standards, though individuals are encouraged to apply for their own funding upon arrival. More information about the Crump lab is available at <a href="http://stemcell.usc.edu/gage-crump-phd.html">http://stemcell.usc.edu/gage-crump-phd.html</a>. To apply, send a curriculum vitae, a brief description of research experience and interests, and the names of three references to <a href="mailto:gcrump@usc.edu">gcrump@usc.edu</a>.

<p>
Post-doctoral position available in the laboratory of Dr. Sudipto Roy, Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore

<p>In our laboratory at the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (IMCB) in Singapore, we are interested in understanding the genetic basis of vertebrate development. For this, we are using the zebrafish embryo as it is uniquely amenable to many kinds of experimental manipulations. To highlight some of our achievements, we have discovered a gene called blimp1 that is required for the specification of a distinct lineage of muscle cells in the zebrafish embryo. These muscle cells, called the slow-twitch muscle cells, are present in all vertebrates and allow sustained muscular activity through aerobic metabolism. Our studies have shown that blimp1 is not just necessary for slow muscle formation, but its activity is also sufficient for inducing nave muscle cells to adopt the slow muscle fiber fate. We have also identified the mechanism by which certain cells are able to differentiate specialized organelles called cilia. For example, in our own bodies, cells of the respiratory tract, the lining of the brain cavities and the spinal cord bear cilia. These cilia are motile and their movement is essential for the transport of fluid - like mucus in the respiratory tract and cerebrospinal fluid in the central nervous system. Our studies have shown that a transcription factor called Foxj1 is essential for controlling the expression of genes that are required to build the cilia. Besides normal development, we are also interested in understanding the processes by which certain tissues are able to regenerate themselves in response to injury. In mammals, regenerative capacity is quite limited. By contrast, lower vertebrates like the zebrafish can regenerate many structures like the heart, retina, fins as well as the spinal cord. Using regeneration of the zebrafish tail fin as a paradigm, we are attempting to discover the genes that are important for the initiation and progression of the regenerative process. We believe that our findings may have implications for regenerative medicine in the treatment of human diseases and injuries.

I am seeking to hire an experienced zebrafish researcher.  We study cell death in epithelia, and have found that cells that die get squeezed out by neighboring cells within the layer.  Because we have also found that cells can still get squeezed out when cell death is blocked, we are investigating if 'extrusion' may allow tumor cells to exit the epithelium to start migrating to other sites within the body.  To do this, we want to develop our studies from cell culture in zebrafish.  We work in excellent, open lab space within The Huntsman Cancer Institute have access to an excellent zebrafish facility.
