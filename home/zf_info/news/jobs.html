<hr>

<p><font face="AGaramond">Research in the Human and Molecular Genetics Laboratory at Johns
Hopkins Singapore is centered on gene discovery and functional genomics in the zebrafish (<em>Danio
rerio</em>) animal model, using retroviral-mediated insertional mutagenesis and other
state-of-the-art technologies. Focus will be on identification and functional
characterization of novel genes involved in zebrafish development that have potential
importance in human congenital malformations. Research space includes a
thermally-controlled aquarium room with automatic photoperiod control, a micromanipulation
and microinjection room, and a well-equipped molecular biology laboratory. In addition,
shared research facilities at Johns Hopkins Singapore include an automated fluorescent
sequencer/genotyper, a fluorescence laser capture microdissection instrument, a
fluorescence inverted compound microscope, an isotopic storage phosphor imager, microplate
reader, scintillation counter, realtime PCR machine, tissue culture room, darkroom, and
radioisotope room. Applications are being sought for an available postdoctoral position in
the laboratory. Applicants should have a PhD with experience in zebrafish or medaka
developmental biology and related techniques. Knowledge of genetics and genomics
techniques would be an asset. </p>

<p>Applications are also being sought from individuals interested in pursuing research in
this field leading to a PhD degree conferred by the National University of Singapore.
Applicants should already have a Masters degree in a related field, but BSc graduates with
a demonstrated enthusiasm and interest in zebrafish or medaka genomics are encouraged to
apply. Applicants should forward a detailed curriculum vitae and the names and addresses
(including phone number and email address) of 3 references via email, or by post to: </p>

the laboratory of Gunter Wagner at Yale University. In this lab, we focus on </p>

  (2) employing experimental approaches that test for the functional significance of these
  molecular differences. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Specifically, we focus on the genetic basis for the origin of the autopodium
(hand/foot) in tetrapod evolution. The successful applicant will work on a project that
integrates understanding the molecular evolution and expression of <em>Hox</em> genes that
pattern fish fins and tetrapod limbs and the progression of morphological changes that are
associated with the fin-limb transition (e.g. Blanco et al., 1998 <em>Dev Genes &amp; Evol</em>

--2000b <em>Mol Phylog &amp; Evo</em>l <strong>17</strong>:305-16). The successful
applicant will also participate in a collaborative effort to discover and comparatively
analyze genes that are specific to the autopodium using gene-expression profiling
approaches. It is expected that the candidate has an intellectual commitment to the
problems of developmental evolution and has demonstrated experience in molecular and
developmental biology techniques including at least PCR, cloning, in situ hybridization,
and analysis of DNA sequences. </p>

<p>Although not a requirement, experience in any of the following areas will be
advantageous: </p>

to identify duplicated genes, particularly those produced during ancient genome
duplication events, to test hypotheses explaining the retention and evolution of
duplicates and to investigate the role of gene and genome duplication in major
evolutionary transitions and radiations with emphasis on the zebrafish, <em>Fugu</em> and
cichlid fishes. A broad knowledge of computers and programming is desirable. Knowledge of
programming languages such as Perl, Python and/or Java would be advantageous. Successful
candidates will join a large internationally well-known research group. </p>

<p>The University is in the beautiful city of Konstanz on the Bodensee in southern
Germany. Zurich is approximately one hour south and Stuttgart is a one and a half hour
drive to the north. The positions are funded for a period of 2 years with salaries
according to German BAT2 or Bat2/2 salary scale (about DM 2,500-3,500 or $ 1,250 or

COMPARATIVE PHYSICAL MAPPING OF THE TILAPIA GENOME</font></p>

<p><font face="AGaramond">The goal of this USDA-funded project is to develop a comparative
physical map of the tilapia genome to support positional cloning of genes controlling
sexual differentiation, growth, color and body shape of this important aquaculture
species. The immediate task is to construct a database of fingerprints for 30,000 BAC
clones by resolving fluorescently-labelled restriction fragments on a capillary sequencer.
The resulting contigs will be anchored to an existing genetic map of microsatellite
polymorphisms by PCR screening of pooled BAC DNAs. We also aim to develop comparative gene
maps with the forthcoming sequences of the pufferfish and zebrafish genomes. </p>

<p>There is considerable scope for the postdoctoral associate to build a research program
related to these comparative physical maps. Other work in the lab is directed at
identifying genes underlying the rapid adaptive radiation of cichlid fishes in the lakes

development and regeneration in zebrafish. Transgenic zebrafish harboring the alpha 1
tubulin gene's promoter driving green fluorescent protein expression have been created.
Transgene GFP expression is induced in developing neuroblasts and differentiating neurons.
As the nervous system matures this expression is suppressed, except in neural stem cells.
In addition, damage to the adult fish CNS results in transgene re-expression in those
neurons able to regenerate their damaged axons. We are using these fish as models for
identifying mechanisms mediating CNS development and regeneration. Projects include a
mutagenesis screen of transgenic fish to identify important regulators of CNS development
and regeneration, and identification and characterization of signaling pathways mediating
transgene induction during CNS development and following injury. </p>
