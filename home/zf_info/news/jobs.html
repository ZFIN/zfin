<p><b>Postdoctoral Research Positions in Neuronal Regeneration</b></p>


<p>One or two postdoctoral research positions are available to participate in the study of neuronal regeneration of the damaged zebrafish retina at the University of Notre Dame. We are using several different paradigms to cause the loss of different neuronal populations, including the light-induced loss of rod and cone photoreceptors (Vihtelic and Hyde (2000) J. Neurobiol. 44: 289-307). Gene microarray experiments have identified a number of candidate genes that are involved in specific stages of the regeneration response and additional microarray experiments are planned to identify candidates that are required for the regeneration of specific neuronal cell types. Genetic tools, such as the Cre-lox and Tet-on systems, are being developed to drive cell-specific and inducible expression of specific transgenes to analyze the regeneration response.</p>

<p>The lab consists of several postdocs and graduate students. Two technicians maintain the feeding and husbandry of the large zebrafish facility (approximately 3,500 tanks) daily. The lab is well-funded by both external grants and money provided by the University.</p>

<p>We are looking for talented individuals who may have experience in molecular biology, genetics, cell biology, genomics, biochemistry, developmental biology or related fields. Previous experience with zebrafish is desirable, but not mandatory. More experienced individuals may be considered to be hired at the non-tenure track Research Assistant Professor level. The successful candidate may start at any time.</p>

Interested candidates should Email a cv and a description of their previous research experience to Dr. David Hyde (<a href="mailto:dhyde@nd.edu">dhyde@nd.edu</a>) and arrange to have three letters of recommendation Emailed directly to the above address.</p>

<p><center><strong>(American University - Washington DC)</strong></center></p><br>

<p>Recently, conservation biologists have been investigating the usefulness of a relatively new tool,<b> fluctuating asymmetry (FA)</b>, for assessing the impact of environmental and genetic stresses on populations. One of the main advantages of FA is its increased sensitivity relative to other bioindicators. If effective, this tool could allow biologists to monitor populations and make recommendations before a severe problem arises, often without the high cost of other solutions.</p>

<p>I have a number of funded FA projects available for graduate students interested in obtaining their MS degree at American University. Study subjects include marine mammal and endangered species. The projects combine FA data with other measures of population health to determine, on a species-by-species basis, whether FA can be used to identify stressed populations before detrimental population decline occurs. </p>

<p>Funded positions include tuition, stipend and, if desired, hourly wages for work as a TA. Basics research support is also provided. If interested please contact:

cloning, gene expression analysis in wild-type embryos and mutants of Notch
signalling. The successful applicant will also be involved in developing an
in vivo system to conditionally manipulate gene expression in the zebrafish
embryos and a transcriptional profile analysis among mutants by microarray
technique.</p>

<p>Applicants should possess a Ph.D. degree and, preferably, have a first

background in genetics, developmental biology and experience in molecular
biology is vital, prior experience with zebrafish advantageous but not
essential.</p>

<p>IMCB is an institute with state-of-the-art infrastructure and equipment

axis determination, hemopoiesis to liver development. In addition, several
other laboratories also use zebrafish as a model system, for example, to
study immunological systems or produce cDNA microarrays.</p>

A Ph.D. student position is open at the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory, University of Southern Mississippi, Ocean Spring, MS (<a href="http://www.usm.edu/gcrl">http://www.usm.edu/gcrl</a> ). The anticipated start date is September 2005, but early employment is possible. This position is funded by the Aquatic Research Consortium (ARC) and the degree would be in the Department of
Coastal Sciences, College of Science and Technology. This is a graduate research assistant position and involves analysis of the effects of exposure to hypoxia and contaminants in small fish species (Japanese medaka and sheepshead minnows). Endpoints being analyzed include early-life stage toxicity and changes in gene expression (toxicogenomics)
in both laboratory exposures and field samples. Our laboratory is equipped with a comparative genomics core (custom microarray production, automatic DNA sequencer, bioanalyzer, real-time PCR), embryo imaging instruments,
and a massive aquatic toxicology facility (12,000 square feet). Experience in one of the following areas is a plus: fluorescent in situ hybridization, fish embryo microinjection, fish embryo imaging, or microarray analysis. No set deadline for application is in place. If interested, please use the contact information below.
