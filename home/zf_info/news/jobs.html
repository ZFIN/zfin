<p>Candidates for the Endowed Chair should have qualifications to join the College at the
rank of Professor, should be nationally and/or internationally recognized for
accomplishments in an area of functional genomics and should possess a record of
excellence in teaching and research. The precise area of research is less important than
demonstrated potential to enhance the quality and strength of genomic/proteomic-based
research at UNH. Special consideration will be given to candidates with research
excellence in areas of genomics that compliment existing research at UNH, including Marine
and Freshwater Biology, Environmental Sciences, Plant &amp; Microbial Biology and
established/emerging model organisms. The incumbent will be expected to maintain an
innovative externally-funded research program, to contribute to undergraduate/graduate
education, and to provide leadership in furthering the goals of the College as well as the
institute for genomic studies. A strong record of excellence in teaching, research,
leadership and collaboration will be required. </p>

<p>A competitive package for salary, start up funds and space is available. Nominations or
applications should be accompanied by a curriculum vitae. Applications should also include
a letter of interest and the names, phone numbers and email addresses of five individuals
who could serve as references. Review of applications will begin on </font><font color="#FF0000" face="AGaramond">February 1, 2001</font><font face="AGaramond"> and

<p><font face="AGaramond">A NIH funded ( 5 years) postdoctoral position is available to
study the role of lipid metabolism and phospholipase signaling during zebrafish
development using real-time optical biosensors. Projects are directed towards the
identification of genetic pathways which regulate lipid metabolism in the context of organ
development with potential importance in human colon cancer. Mutagenesis screens using
fluorescent lipids exploit the unique advantages of the zebrafish for coupling genetic
analyses to real-time imaging of enzymatic function. Mutations revealed by these reagents,
will lead to the identification of genes that regulate physiological and developmental
processes that cannot be assayed using conventional screening strategies. Examples include
genes that regulate lipid and prostaglandin metabolism, intestinal and liver transport and
development of the biliary tract. Identification of these genes has important implications
for cancer research and research related to diseases of the liver, intestine and
cardiovascular system. This position will include phenotypic screens for lipid processing
mutants, mapping candidate genes, positional cloning and gene isolation efforts.

COMPARATIVE PHYSICAL MAPPING OF THE TILAPIA GENOME</font></p>

<p><font face="Albertus Extra Bold"><strong>Position Summary</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="AGaramond">The goal of this USDA-funded project is to develop a comparative
physical map of the tilapia genome to support positional cloning of genes controlling
sexual differentiation, growth, color and body shape of this important aquaculture
species. The immediate task is to construct a database of fingerprints for 30,000 BAC
clones by resolving fluorescently-labelled restriction fragments on a capillary sequencer.
The resulting contigs will be anchored to an existing genetic map of microsatellite
polymorphisms by PCR screening of pooled BAC DNAs. We also aim to develop comparative gene
maps with the forthcoming sequences of the pufferfish and zebrafish genomes. </p>

<p>There is considerable scope for the postdoctoral associate to build a research program
related to these comparative physical maps. Other work in the lab is directed at
identifying genes underlying the rapid adaptive radiation of cichlid fishes in the lakes
of East Africa.</font></p>

<p><font face="AGaramond">Postdoctoral positions available immediately to study CNS
development and regeneration in zebrafish. Transgenic zebrafish harboring the alpha 1
tubulin gene's promoter driving green fluorescent protein expression have been created.
Transgene GFP expression is induced in developing neuroblasts and differentiating neurons.
As the nervous system matures this expression is suppressed, except in neural stem cells.
In addition, damage to the adult fish CNS results in transgene re-expression in those
neurons able to regenerate their damaged axons. We are using these fish as models for
identifying mechanisms mediating CNS development and regeneration. Projects include a
mutagenesis screen of transgenic fish to identify important regulators of CNS development
and regeneration, and identification and characterization of signaling pathways mediating
transgene induction during CNS development and following injury. </p>
