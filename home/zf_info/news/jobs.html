<center><strong>(Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah )</strong></center><br>

<p>
A postdoctoral research position is available immediately at the Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah in the laboratory of Dr. Cicely Jette.  In my lab, we use the forward genetic capacity of the zebrafish model system to identify novel genes required to protect cells from DNA damage. The proteins encoded by these genes are potential therapeutic targets whose inactivation will re-sensitize cancer cells that have become resistant to DNA-damage-inducing therapies. To this end, we have identified a number of zebrafish lines harboring ENU-induced mutations in novel radioprotective genes.  Current projects involve dissecting the functions of these genes through 1) genetic epistasis analysis in zebrafish embryos, 2) biochemical analysis in mammalian cell culture and 3) analysis of therapeutic potential using a zebrafish model of radioresistant T-cell leukemia.  For more information, see: <a href="http://medicine.utah.edu/oncsci/faculty/cjette.htm">http://medicine.utah.edu/oncsci/faculty/cjette.htm</a>.
 
<p>The successful candidate must have an Ph.D. and/or M.D. or equivalent and should have experience in genetics and cell culture as demonstrated by significant first author publications.  Zebrafish experience is preferred, but not necessary.
 
<p>To apply for this position, please submit a cover letter containing a concise description of research experience and interests, and a CV containing 3 references to:

<p>
A highly motivated and ambitious PhD, MD, or MD/PhD scientist is sought to join the emerging field of chemical genetics. My laboratory has identified a number of small molecules that perturb zebrafish embryonic patterning. The first goal is to study how these small molecules function by identifying their cellular targets using cell biological and biochemical approaches. The second goal is to explore whether these small molecules promote development of specific cell and tissue types in pluripotent stem cell models. Lastly, since aberrant activities of many of developmental pathways are thought to play a major role in pathogenesis of variety of human diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases and anemia, an important goal is to explore therapeutic potential of chemical modulation of these pathways in various murine disease models. Toward the last goal, the candidate will be working closely with medicinal chemistry colleagues in the Vanderbilt Program for Drug Discovery.  The candidate must have good communication skills, experience in cell and molecular biology, and tissue culture techniques.  Experience in zebrafish embryology, zebrafish transgenic methods, drug target identification, protein biochemistry, mouse cancer models, and/or embryonic stem cells are a plus.

Applications are invited to join the research team of Professor Peter Cullen to study the role of phosphoinositides mediated membrane trafficking through the endocytic network during zebrafish development.

<p>With the increasing number of diseases linked to defects in the metabolism of endosomal phosphoinositides (e.g. neuropathies and myopathies), the laboratory aims to achieve a thorough mechanistic understanding of how phosphoinositides regulate endosomal function by identifying and characterizing specific phosphoinositide receptor proteins and their associated protein complexes. In doing so, we seek to generate new insight into the importance of endosomal phosphoinositides in health and disease (see Nat Cell Biol 9, 1370-1380 (2007), Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol 9, 574 (2008); Dev Cell 17, 110-122 (2009), <a href="http://www.bris.ac.uk/biochemistry/cullen/index.html">http://www.bris.ac.uk/biochemistry/cullen/index.html</a>).

GRADUATE OPPORTUNITIES IN BIOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI
The Department of Biology at the University of Miami is pleased to announce the availability of travel awards for prospective PhD students.  Awarded on a competitive basis, each award provides a domestic roundtrip flight to Miami, Florida and covers lodging while in Miami.  Travel awards provide interested students with the opportunity to meet faculty, graduate students, and their prospective cohort.  Awards will be announced by early February 2010, and travel will be scheduled for March 25-28th 2010.

<p>The Biology Department has recently expanded its facilities and its faculty, with a large influx of new faculty working in three core areas: Neurobiology, Developmental Biology, and Ecological and Evolutionary Genomics.  Among these new faculty members, three groups use zebrafish as a model organism for neural plasticity (Dr. Julia Dallman, <a href="mailto:jdallman@bio.miami.edu">jdallman@bio.miami.edu</a>), auditory system development (Dr. John Lu, <a href="mailto:zlu@fig.cox.miami.edu">zlu@fig.cox.miami.edu</a>) and CNS patterning and development (Dr. Isaac Skromne, <a href="mailto:iskromne@bio.miami.edu">iskromne@bio.miami.edu</a>).   These new research strengths coupled with strong traditions in Ecology, Behavior and Tropical Biology combine to create a department that provides broad and integrative training in the biological sciences.  This vibrant environment also fosters an abundance of opportunities to pursue interdisciplinary research.  Biology interacts with researchers from the medical and marine campuses, the Center for Computational Science, and the Departments of Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science.  Biology also utilizes local resources such as the Everglades, the Fairchild Botanic Garden and the Organization for Tropical Studies.  These programs and opportunities assure a graduate program of excellence.

<p>Support for graduate study is available through multiple sources, including departmental research assistantships, teaching assistantships, and University fellowships.  Graduate students admitted to the PhD program are guaranteed stipend support and tuition waivers for ten semesters.

<p>To be considered for a travel award, prospective PhD students need only apply for admittance to our graduate program: <a href="http://www.bio.miami.edu/grad.html">http://www.bio.miami.edu/grad.html</a>.

<center><strong>(LIRANS Institute, University of Bedfordshire, UK)</strong></center><br>

<p>
Applications are invited for two PhD Studentships (closing date for
application 19 October 2009)

<p>Development and cryopreservation of fish stem cell lines
(Director of Studies: Prof Tiantian Zhang)
<p>Cryo-impact on fibroblasts and iPS stem cells  (Director of
Studies:          Prof. David Rawson)

<p>LIRANS Institute of Research in the Applied Natural Sciences,
University of Bedfordshire, Luton, LU2 8DL, UK

<p>Bursary:	&pound; 13,290 per annum.
<br>Start Date: late 2009/early 2010

<p>Bursary available initially for 2 years for MPhil stage, option to
complete further year for PhD completion, subject to satisfactory
progress.

<p>The LIRANS Institute of Research in the Applied Natural Sciences is an
established Research Institute of the University presently consisting of
14 senior research staff, 7 PhD students and 8 visiting professors and
fellows. Research students will join this multi-disciplinary team, who
are engaged in strategic and applied research, and postgraduate
training, in the areas of cryobiology, sensor technology, measurement
science, process control and environmental monitoring.

<p>The Institute is located in a new, dedicated facility in the
Butterfield Science and Business Park in Luton, and benefits from
*state of the art* laboratory facilities and excellent staff
accommodation.

<p>Nature and Scope: 	Cryobiology is a major theme within the
Institute, which attracts external research funding from research
councils, charities and industry, and offers research degree programmes
for MSc (Research) and PhD.

<p>Cryobiology research at LIRANS is exploring the impact of
cryo-protocols on a range of biological material.  The Institute*s
main themes have been the cryo-preservation of gametes, embryos and
embryonic cells of the zebrafish, an important model species in
developmental biology and genetics.

<p>In addition to staff research and research degree programmes, LIRANS
also runs a taught masters course - MSc Biotechnology -  which
incorporates three main themes: Cell and Molecular Biology; Cryobiology;
and Analytical and Diagnostic Technology.  Students also undertake a
dissertation and research project linked to one of the themes.  

<p>Project 1:  Development and cryopreservation of fish stem cell lines

<p>The project seeks to develop techniques for cryopreservation of fish
stem cells. The investigation will include studies on isolation and
culture of fish embryonic cells, development of cryopreservation
protocols for these cells and studies on the effect of cryopreservation
on stability and genetic integrity of these cells.


<p>Project 2: Cryo-impact on fibroblasts and iPS stem cells

<p>The research will be undertaken on cell lines derived from zebrafish
tissue explants.  This will include transformed somatic cell lines to
iPS cells - stem cell like, pleuripotent cells - by viral vector
vectors.  Whilst cryopreservation of many cell types has been
successfully achieved, there is a growing concern that subtle impacts
may be induced during the cryo-treatment which do not result in a loss
of viability but may have long-term implications in certain applications
- for example stem cell therapy.  The proposed programme will seek to
identify possible effects of cryo-treatment and to develop protocols
that reduce damaging impacts.

<p>Principal Accountabilities

<p>1.	To develop a personal area of research study as a programme for
registration the degree of MPhil with transfer to PhD.
