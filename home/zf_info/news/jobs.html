<p>
A postdoctoral position is available from 1 Dec 2009 in a new neurobiology group working on the application of new genetically encoded neurotoxins in basic and clinical neuroscience using the zebrafish (Danio rerio). Our group actively develops transgenic methods to genetically identify interneurons in the intact spinal cord or midbrain that drive locomotion and goal-orientated motor behaviors. A major goal is to unravel the role of discrete neurons in specific behaviors by systematic silencing of neurons in vivo. By using Gal4/UAS or Cre/LoxP binary expression systems, we can target neurotoxins to small populations of neurons in the brain or spinal cord in vivo, and analyze the function of these neurons in sensory-motor behaviors using high-speed imaging and electrophysiology. Identified neurons and circuits are used in turn as paradigms for testing new genetically modified neurotoxins with potential neurotherapeutic value. There are several possible projects available, including the functional analysis of newly identified subclasses of spinal interneurons, dissection of midbrain circuits underlying prey capture behavior, and development of conditional or modified neurotoxins. Each of these projects allows the unique opportunity to combine transgenic, behavioral and electrophysiological approaches as well as live imaging to gain new insight into the development and function of neural circuits and behavior. 

<p>Applicants should have a PhD in a discipline related to the project and a strong interest in molecular genetics, development and neuroscience. Experience in molecular biology and biochemistry including DNA cloning and PCR is desired. Expertise in electrophysiology using model organisms would be a significant advantage.
The postdoctoral position is initially for 2 years with the possibility of extension. Salary starts at 436.800 NOK. For further information regarding the position and scientific content of the project please contact Max Suster, Group Leader, at <a href="mailto:maximiliano.suster@sars.uib.no">maximiliano.suster@sars.uib.no</a>

Specifically, we are interested in the role of the TGF-beta type I receptor, ALK1, in vascular development and disease.  ALK1 function is critical in vascular development and homeostasis: homozygous ALK1 mutations are embryonic lethal, whereas the heterozygous condition results in the autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia, Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia Type 2 (HHT2).

of Cologne, Germany. The project is part of the Cologne Excellence Cluster on
Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), and deals with
the formation and function of the hypothalamic-hypophyseal axis, with
particular focus on the neuroendocrine control of feeding behavior, energy
homeostasis, obesity and somatic growth, using the zebrafish as a model
organism.

<p>Studies include the generation of transgenic lines for in vivo imaging of the
plasticity within the hypothalamic melanocortin system in wild-type and mutant
fish under different physiological conditions, as well as mutant screens after
chemical and insertional mutagenesis.

<p>Applications are invited from candidates who have a background in developmental,
cellular and/or molecular biology, or in endocrinology. Please send your
application, together with your CV and a list of referees, preferably via
email, to:
