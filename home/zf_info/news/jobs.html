<p>
The "Biology of Ageing" Laboratory (A. Cellerino, SNS Pisa, Italy) at the Leibniz Institute for Age Research, Fritz-Lipmann-Institute, Jena, Germany is inviting applications for a
 Postdoctoral position (TV-L E13)

<p>Identification of physiological and molecular mechanisms controlling aging 
in the short-lived fish Nothobranchius furzeri 

<p>Investigations into ageing in vertebrates is hampered by the absence of animals models with very short life span. In addition, very little information is available as to the genes controlling ageing and age-related dysfunctions in natural populations, due to lack of model systems where differences in aging phenotypes among natural populations are well-described. In the last years, we have established the annual fish Nothobranchius furzeri as a new model system for age research. The captive life span of this fish is only few months and it shows a greatly accelerated expression of typical age-related markers and these can be modulated by treatments known to increase lifespan in other model organisms. Populations of the short-lived fish Nothobranchius furzeri show large differences in lifespan and onset of age-related pathologies. 
Our main areas of research are: (1) Testing of life-extending interventions, (2) Identification of biological/molecular differences which correlate with differences in natural lifespan. 
Projects are conducted in strict collaboration with the groups Molecular Biology (Englert) and Genome Analysis (Platzer) within a "Nothobranchius project" at FLI.

<p>Further questions: <a href="mailto:acellerino@fli-leibniz.de">acellerino@fli-leibniz.de</a>

<p>We are looking for a candidate with a strong background in physiology/anatomy/pathology OR molecular biology OR evolutionary biology/behavioural studies with strong team capability, who wishes to contribute to a multidisciplinary project.  Previous experience with fish model systems is a plus, but not a prerequisite. 

<p>The contract conditions and the salary will be according to the collective labour agreement for public service employees of the federal states of Germany (TV-L). The position is initially for two year with the possibility of renewal and is available immediately.

The project will involve analyzing the formation and function of neuronal circuits that mediate the stress response in zebrafish. The stress response is crucial for homeostasis and the survival of an animal, yet chronic stress is detrimental and underlies many pathological conditions such as depression. The goal of this project is to determine the effect of chronic stress on neural circuit formation and function in vivo utilizing transgenic zebrafish lines that express various genetically encoded sensors in cell type specific manner. Circuit formation will be analyzed at single-cell resolution using in vivo time-lapse imaging. Circuit function will be analyzed by combining genetic, optogenetic and pharmacological manipulation with calcium imaging and behavioral analysis.

<p>Interested candidate should have a strong background in neuroscience and practical experiences in microscopy. The position is funded by Marie Curie Fellowship, which offers a very generous stipend, travel and relocation fund.

A postdoctoral research position is available immediately at the Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah in the laboratory of Dr. Cicely Jette.  In my lab, we use the forward genetic capacity of the zebrafish model system to identify novel genes required to protect cells from DNA damage. The proteins encoded by these genes are potential therapeutic targets whose inactivation will re-sensitize cancer cells that have become resistant to DNA-damage-inducing therapies. To this end, we have identified a number of zebrafish lines harboring ENU-induced mutations in novel radioprotective genes.  Current projects involve dissecting the functions of these genes through 1) genetic epistasis analysis in zebrafish embryos, 2) biochemical analysis in mammalian cell culture and 3) analysis of therapeutic potential using a zebrafish model of radioresistant T-cell leukemia.

Applications are invited to join the research team of Professor Peter Cullen to study the role of phosphoinositides mediated membrane trafficking through the endocytic network during zebrafish development.

<p>With the increasing number of diseases linked to defects in the metabolism of endosomal phosphoinositides (e.g. neuropathies and myopathies), the laboratory aims to achieve a thorough mechanistic understanding of how phosphoinositides regulate endosomal function by identifying and characterizing specific phosphoinositide receptor proteins and their associated protein complexes. In doing so, we seek to generate new insight into the importance of endosomal phosphoinositides in health and disease (see Nat Cell Biol 9, 1370-1380 (2007), Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol 9, 574 (2008); Dev Cell 17, 110-122 (2009), <a href="http://www.bris.ac.uk/biochemistry/cullen/index.html">http://www.bris.ac.uk/biochemistry/cullen/index.html</a>).

<p>
GRADUATE OPPORTUNITIES IN BIOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI
The Department of Biology at the University of Miami is pleased to announce the availability of travel awards for prospective PhD students.  Awarded on a competitive basis, each award provides a domestic roundtrip flight to Miami, Florida and covers lodging while in Miami.  Travel awards provide interested students with the opportunity to meet faculty, graduate students, and their prospective cohort.  Awards will be announced by early February 2010, and travel will be scheduled for March 25-28th 2010.

<p>The Biology Department has recently expanded its facilities and its faculty, with a large influx of new faculty working in three core areas: Neurobiology, Developmental Biology, and Ecological and Evolutionary Genomics.  Among these new faculty members, three groups use zebrafish as a model organism for neural plasticity (Dr. Julia Dallman, <a href="mailto:jdallman@bio.miami.edu">jdallman@bio.miami.edu</a>), auditory system development (Dr. John Lu, <a href="mailto:zlu@fig.cox.miami.edu">zlu@fig.cox.miami.edu</a>) and CNS patterning and development (Dr. Isaac Skromne, <a href="mailto:iskromne@bio.miami.edu">iskromne@bio.miami.edu</a>).   These new research strengths coupled with strong traditions in Ecology, Behavior and Tropical Biology combine to create a department that provides broad and integrative training in the biological sciences.  This vibrant environment also fosters an abundance of opportunities to pursue interdisciplinary research.  Biology interacts with researchers from the medical and marine campuses, the Center for Computational Science, and the Departments of Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science.  Biology also utilizes local resources such as the Everglades, the Fairchild Botanic Garden and the Organization for Tropical Studies.  These programs and opportunities assure a graduate program of excellence.

<p>Support for graduate study is available through multiple sources, including departmental research assistantships, teaching assistantships, and University fellowships.  Graduate students admitted to the PhD program are guaranteed stipend support and tuition waivers for ten semesters.

<p>To be considered for a travel award, prospective PhD students need only apply for admittance to our graduate program: <a href="http://www.bio.miami.edu/grad.html">http://www.bio.miami.edu/grad.html</a>.  Information about our faculty and their research interests can be found at: <a href="http://www.bio.miami.edu">http://www.bio.miami.edu</a>.

<p>While closing date for consideration is January 1st, 2010, exceptional students may be accepted on a rolling basis. Direct inquiries to Marisa Hightower, Graduate Program Administrator, <a href="mailto:mhightower@bio.miami.edu">mhightower@bio.miami.edu</a>
