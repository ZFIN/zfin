<h2 align="center"><font color="#004080" size="5"><a name="ifremer">Two PhD Positions</a></font></h2>

<center><strong>(Ifremer)</strong></center><br>

<p>
Ifremer is a multidisciplinary sea research institute (<a href="http://www.ifremer.fr/anglais/">http://www.ifremer.fr/anglais/</a>). For several years now, we develop at L'Houmeau site (nearby La Rochelle) projects aiming at understanding how organic pollutants can affect fish development and what are the long-term consequences on fish physiology and populations using zebrafish.

<p>We propose two PhD positions starting nov 2010:
<br>1) Deterioration of the physiology of fish exposed to polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) - Ontogenesis and functional integrity
The objective of this project is to better characterize physiological alterations of fish exposed to PAH and in particular to evaluate the long-term repercussions of an exposure to PAH during early stages of the development, i.e. embryo-larval stages, focusing on growth, behavior and reproduction. We will also seek to identify the mechanisms underpinning the appearance of these alterations.

<p>The candidate should have an expertise in developmental biology and physiology (preferably in fish) and on the associated tools (molecular biology, imagery). Knowledge of the concepts and techniques used in the study of behavior and ecotoxicology will be an advantage.

<p>2) Development of relevant and predictive embryonic tests of early and late toxic effects for hydrophobic molecules
The objective of this project of thesis is to use 3 mixtures of polyaromatic hydrocarbons with different physicochemical properties like model molecules in order 1) to set up specific tests for the hydrophobic molecules whose toxicity cannot be correctly evaluated by aqueous tests; 2) to identify a battery of relevant indicators able to reveal a broad range of potential toxic effects and 3) to evaluate the capacity for these indicators defined on young stages to be as much as possible predictive of late effects in order to avoid underestimating the toxic character of a molecule by limiting their relevance at the young stages.

<p>The candidate should have an expertise in ecotoxicology, developmental biology and physiology (preferably in fish) and on the associated tools (molecular biology, imagery).

<p>To apply for these positions, please submit a cover letter containing a concise description of your research experience, the number of your preferred subject, your CV and names of two references (and their contact information) to: Xavier Cousin - <a href="mailto:xavier.cousin@ifremer.fr">xavier.cousin@ifremer.fr</a>

<p>Application is open until May 28, 2010.

<h2 align="center"><font color="#004080" size="5"><a name="stanford">Postdoctoral Position </a></font></h2>

<center><strong>(Stanford University, Stanford, CA)</strong></center><br>

<p>
We are seeking to fill a postdoctoral position with a project focus on zebrafish development in the Riedel-Kruse Lab, Bioengineering Department, Stanford. 

<p>We are fascinated by the emergent dynamics of biological systems - with one focus of our lab on understanding how genetic networks orchestrate the dynamics and mechanics of developing embryos. We take a physics approach by iterating between mathematical models and quantitative experiments. Zebrafish is particularly amenable to this approach due to its fast and external development, optical transparency, large number of eggs in a clutch needed for statistics, and the variety of genetic tools available. Our work will result in new quantitative methods to monitor and perturb these genetic networks, and we aim for conceptually deeper insights into key developmental principles such as the utility of entrained genetic oscillators and mechanical forces / motors for the patterning of a growing tissue. Please see Riedel-Kruse, I.H., Muller, C., and Oates, A.C.; Synchrony dynamics during initiation, failure and rescue of the segmentation clock. Science (2007) 317: 1911; or visit our website at <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/riedel-kruse/">http://www.stanford.edu/group/riedel-kruse/</a>

<p>This position offers the interdisciplinary advantages of Stanford in general, and the Bioengineering and Developmental Biology departments, in particular. Multiple groups working on Zebrafish provide a vibrant and interactive community; the embedding of our lab in the Bioengineering Department facilitates collaborations on many emerging technologies.

<p>You should be highly motivated and technically accomplished as documented by an exceptional publication record. The ideal candidate will have demonstrated experience with vertebrate developmental model systems and a strong background in molecular biology. Prior experience with zebrafish is desired, but not essential. Experience with computational and theoretical approaches would be a plus, but are not explicitly required - and this position particularly offers the opportunity to develop and strengthen this skill set within our interdisciplinary environment. Most of all, we value curiosity, creativity, and a pleasant personality.

<p>Please email CV incl. a list of relevant publications to the contact information below. Applicants accepted for initial consideration will be subsequently contacted for letters of reference. Please also mention whether you plan to travel to the bay area in the near future, or plan to attend relevant meetings (especially the Zebrafish meeting in Madison, June 16th-20th).

Multiple postdoctoral positions are currently open in the Lawson Laboratory in the Program in Gene Function and Expression, University of Massachusetts Medical School.

<p>Generation of novel zebrafish gene knock-out models for the study of angiogenesis.
A postdoctoral position is available to apply zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) technology to generate zebrafish knock-out models related to blood vessel development. This position will provide a unique opportunity to exploit and further develop ZFN technology in zebrafish as part of an ongoing collaborative effort between the neighboring laboratories of Drs. Nathan Lawson and Scot Wolfe. This effort will provide the successful applicant with the opportunity to master modular- and selection-based systems used to generate and evaluate site-specific ZFNs. The genetic models developed in the context of these studies will be used to address questions of interest relating to endothelial cell differentiation and angiogenesis. Particular emphasis will be on the application of ZFNs in the context of a reverse genetic screen to interrogate novel regulators of vascular development, as well as development of zebrafish models for vascular disease.


<p>Studying blood vessel formation and function using the zebrafish as a model system.
A postdoctoral position is available to utilize the zebrafish as a model system to study blood vessel development. Areas of particular interest include the following: transcriptional regulatory networks required for endothelial specification and blood vessel identity, the role of Notch signaling during vascular development, how mechanosensory inputs are integrated with developmental signaling pathways during blood vessel morphogenesis, and the role of microRNAs in vascular development. We take full advantage of the many benefits of the zebrafish model including the application of in vivo imaging by 2-photon microscopy, genetic manipulation through the use of zinc finger nucleases, and development of transgenic sensor lines for visualizing signaling outputs in vivo.

<br>Department of Biological Sciences
<br>University of Pittsburgh


<p>An NIH-funded postdoctoral position in the Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Pittsburgh, is available immediately to study vascular development using the zebrafish as a model system.  Our laboratory employs a diverse array of molecular, biochemical, imaging, and embryological techniques to elucidate genetic pathways that control vascular development.   Specifically, we are interested in the role of the TGF-beta type I receptor, ALK1, in vascular development and disease.  ALK1 function is critical in vascular development and homeostasis: homozygous ALK1 mutations are embryonic lethal, whereas the heterozygous condition results in the autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia, Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia Type 2 (HHT2).  Our laboratory is interested in investigating the regulation of alk1 expression; identifying downstream targets of Alk1 activation; and probing the cellular role of Alk1 within the endothelium.

<p>Our department is home to an interactive group of Developmental Biologists studying a variety of developmental processes in zebrafish, Drosophila, mouse, and C. elegans. Our laboratory is also part of an active and growing zebrafish community on the University of Pittsburgh campus, as well as the campus-wide Center for Vascular Remodeling and Regeneration.
 
<p>Qualified candidates must have a PhD in a relevant field, and a strong publication record.  Interested candidates should send (1) a brief cover letter summarizing scientific accomplishments and stating future research goals; (2) a full CV; and (3) full contact information for three references to Beth Roman at <a href="mailto:romanb@pitt.edu">romanb@pitt.edu</a>.

<center><strong>(Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah )</strong></center><br>

<p>
A postdoctoral research position is available immediately at the Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah in the laboratory of Dr. Cicely Jette.  In my lab, we use the forward genetic capacity of the zebrafish model system to identify novel genes required to protect cells from DNA damage. The proteins encoded by these genes are potential therapeutic targets whose inactivation will re-sensitize cancer cells that have become resistant to DNA-damage-inducing therapies. To this end, we have identified a number of zebrafish lines harboring ENU-induced mutations in novel radioprotective genes.  Current projects involve dissecting the functions of these genes through 1) genetic epistasis analysis in zebrafish embryos, 2) biochemical analysis in mammalian cell culture and 3) analysis of therapeutic potential using a zebrafish model of radioresistant T-cell leukemia.  For more information, see: <a href="http://medicine.utah.edu/oncsci/faculty/cjette.htm">http://medicine.utah.edu/oncsci/faculty/cjette.htm</a>.
 
<p>The successful candidate must have an Ph.D. and/or M.D. or equivalent and should have experience in genetics and cell culture as demonstrated by significant first author publications.  Zebrafish experience is preferred, but not necessary.

<p>
The "Biology of Ageing" Laboratory (A. Cellerino, SNS Pisa, Italy) at the Leibniz Institute for Age Research, Fritz-Lipmann-Institute, Jena, Germany is inviting applications for a
 Postdoctoral position (TV-L E13)

<p>Identification of physiological and molecular mechanisms controlling aging 
in the short-lived fish Nothobranchius furzeri 

<p>Investigations into ageing in vertebrates is hampered by the absence of animals models with very short life span. In addition, very little information is available as to the genes controlling ageing and age-related dysfunctions in natural populations, due to lack of model systems where differences in aging phenotypes among natural populations are well-described. In the last years, we have established the annual fish Nothobranchius furzeri as a new model system for age research. The captive life span of this fish is only few months and it shows a greatly accelerated expression of typical age-related markers and these can be modulated by treatments known to increase lifespan in other model organisms. Populations of the short-lived fish Nothobranchius furzeri show large differences in lifespan and onset of age-related pathologies. 
Our main areas of research are: (1) Testing of life-extending interventions, (2) Identification of biological/molecular differences which correlate with differences in natural lifespan. 
Projects are conducted in strict collaboration with the groups Molecular Biology (Englert) and Genome Analysis (Platzer) within a "Nothobranchius project" at FLI.

The project will involve analyzing the formation and function of neuronal circuits that mediate the stress response in zebrafish. The stress response is crucial for homeostasis and the survival of an animal, yet chronic stress is detrimental and underlies many pathological conditions such as depression. The goal of this project is to determine the effect of chronic stress on neural circuit formation and function in vivo utilizing transgenic zebrafish lines that express various genetically encoded sensors in cell type specific manner. Circuit formation will be analyzed at single-cell resolution using in vivo time-lapse imaging. Circuit function will be analyzed by combining genetic, optogenetic and pharmacological manipulation with calcium imaging and behavioral analysis.

<p>Interested candidate should have a strong background in neuroscience and practical experiences in microscopy. The position is funded by Marie Curie Fellowship, which offers a very generous stipend, travel and relocation fund.
