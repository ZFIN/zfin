<p>Your Challenge
<br>Under the general direction of a Research Officer, the Research Associate will work with a team of scientists and technologists to develop an in vivo zebrafish bioassay to examine the preclinical toxicity of novel anti-infective drugs.  Specifically, the development of these assays will focus on in vivo acute, cardio and developmental toxicity.  Once developed and validated, these assays will be used to assess toxicity of other potential therapeutic agents.
 
<p>This position is part of the Atlantic Initiative program and, in the case of the IMB component, one of our major goals is to develop the life-science cluster in the region. As such, the Research Associate will be required to liaise with a local biotechnology company that is part of this collaborative project.  In addition to the research duties outlined below, the Research Associate will be required to prepare reports, publications and present results to the industrial collaborator and to the life science community.


<p>Your Credentials

<p>Education
<br>As part of the RA Program you must have received your PhD in biochemistry, molecular biology, developmental biology, toxicology, pharmacology or related fields within the last 5 years or you expect to receive the degree within the next 6 months.

<p>Experience 
<br>Graduate or Post-doctoral experience in zebrafish-related research.
<br>Experience in molecular biology (RT-PCR), developmental biology and in situ hybridization.
<br>Experience in the operation of fluorescence and light microscopy.
<br>Experience in the study of toxicology or pharmacology related research is desirable.

<p>Salary Range
<br>The Research Associate Program is unique to the NRC. It falls under the RO/RCO classification system which uses a person-based classification system instead of the more common duties-based classification system. Candidates are remunerated based on their expertise, skill, outcomes and impacts of their previous work experience. In addition to the salary, employees in the RA Group are entitled to a Terminable Allowance of $8,000 per year.

<p>
Graduate research assistantship (Ph.D.) to work on the development and evolution of skeletal adaptations in Antarctic icefish.

<p>Albertson Lab, Department of Biology, Syracuse University

<p>The highly successful evolutionary radiation of Antarctic notothenioid fish involved several structural changes in the musculoskeletal system to accommodate a pelagic lifestyle. These include the evolution of bone loss to increase buoyancy, and craniofacial adaptations to accommodate shits in diet and foraging strategies. Up to four years of funding (via research assistantship) are available to study the genetic and developmental mechanisms that underlie these skeletal adaptations.

<p>The successful applicant will interact with other students in the lab (undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral) participating in a variety of projects using a number of systems including zebrafish, African cichlids and Antarctic icefish.  The approach of the lab is to integrate studies in a laboratory model (i.e., zebrafish) and natural populations (i.e., cichlids) to understand the evolution of animal form and function. Methods of study include comparative embryology, developmental and molecular genetics, quantitative genetics, and morphometric shape analysis.

<p>For more information about ongoing projects in the lab please visit my website at <a href="http://albertsonlab.syr.edu/research.html">http://albertsonlab.syr.edu/research.html</a>.

<p>A fully funded postdoctoral position is available to study one of two projects related to the formation of the vertebrate head skeleton. The first project, which is funded by a grant from the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), uses both zebrafish and human stem cell models to investigate the origin of head skeletal precursors. Specifically, we plan to use new transgenic tools to address the role of chromatin remodeling in jaw regeneration in zebrafish and early lineage decisions in human ES cells. The second project, funded by an NIH R01 grant, focuses on how local signaling centers control head skeletal patterning in zebrafish. To do so, we plan to use a UAS/Gal4 library to misexpress growth factors in specific domains, followed by time-lapse imaging to assess the behavioral consequences on skeletal precursors.

<p>
Post-doctoral position available in the laboratory of Dr. Sudipto Roy, Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore

<p>In our laboratory at the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (IMCB) in Singapore, we are interested in understanding the genetic basis of vertebrate development. For this, we are using the zebrafish embryo as it is uniquely amenable to many kinds of experimental manipulations. To highlight some of our achievements, we have discovered a gene called blimp1 that is required for the specification of a distinct lineage of muscle cells in the zebrafish embryo. These muscle cells, called the slow-twitch muscle cells, are present in all vertebrates and allow sustained muscular activity through aerobic metabolism. Our studies have shown that blimp1 is not just necessary for slow muscle formation, but its activity is also sufficient for inducing nave muscle cells to adopt the slow muscle fiber fate. We have also identified the mechanism by which certain cells are able to differentiate specialized organelles called cilia. For example, in our own bodies, cells of the respiratory tract, the lining of the brain cavities and the spinal cord bear cilia. These cilia are motile and their movement is essential for the transport of fluid - like mucus in the respiratory tract and cerebrospinal fluid in the central nervous system. Our studies have shown that a transcription factor called Foxj1 is essential for controlling the expression of genes that are required to build the cilia. Besides normal development, we are also interested in understanding the processes by which certain tissues are able to regenerate themselves in response to injury. In mammals, regenerative capacity is quite limited. By contrast, lower vertebrates like the zebrafish can regenerate many structures like the heart, retina, fins as well as the spinal cord. Using regeneration of the zebrafish tail fin as a paradigm, we are attempting to discover the genes that are important for the initiation and progression of the regenerative process. We believe that our findings may have implications for regenerative medicine in the treatment of human diseases and injuries.

<p>
Postdoctoral Fellow, Vascular Development in the Zebrafish

<p>A fully funded postdoctoral position is available at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD, to study vascular development in the zebrafish.  Our laboratory uses molecular, cellular, genetic, and transgenic approaches to study the specification, patterning, and differentiation of the developing vascular system. Some of our current areas of research interest include: understanding how vessels are specified and differentiate as arteries, veins, or lymphatics; understanding how vessels assemble into reproducibly patterned networks, and what cues guide this patterning; studying how endothelial cells undergo morphogenesis into tubular vessels in vivo using high-resolution multiphoton imaging and experimental manipulation; and isolating novel vascular-specific mutants and studying the molecular basis for their defects.

<p>The scientific environment, resources, and stipend support are superb. See <a href="http://dir.nichd.nih.gov/lmg/uvo/WEINSLAB.html">http://dir.nichd.nih.gov/lmg/uvo/WEINSLAB.html</a> for additional information.

<p>Interested applicants should have a Ph.D. or M.D. and less than 3 years' postdoctoral experience. To apply, send a curriculum vitae, bibliography, cover letter with a brief description of research experience and interests, and the names of 3 references (with phone numbers) via e-mail to <a href="mailto:flyingfish2@nih.gov">flyingfish2@nih.gov</a>.

<p>
I am seeking to hire an experienced zebrafish researcher.  We study cell death in epithelia, and have found that cells that die get squeezed out by neighboring cells within the layer.  Because we have also found that cells can still get squeezed out when cell death is blocked, we are investigating if 'extrusion' may allow tumor cells to exit the epithelium to start migrating to other sites within the body.  To do this, we want to develop our studies from cell culture in zebrafish.  We work in excellent, open lab space within The Huntsman Cancer Institute have access to an excellent zebrafish facility. We can entertain positions about at any level, but really need an experienced zebrafish researcher.

<p>Description of the project: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder and the most prevalent cause of dementia for which there is currently no treatment..  Inherited, Familial AD (FAD) is caused predominantly by mutations in presenilin (PS) genes. To model AD in vivo we are generating transgenic fish carrying human FAD-PS1 mutations. Zebrafish is unique among vertebrates in its amenability to genetic and chemical screens. We will exploit this advantage in order to discover genes and chemicals that can modify (suppress or enhance) aberrant phenotypes that derive from malfunctions of mutated Presenilin-1 that causes FAD. The primary goals are to study the biology of FAD-PS1 expressing cells at the single cell level and to discover molecular entry points into pathway(s) that mediate FAD-PS1 phenotypes To this end we will perform genetic and chemical screens on zebrafish embryos that are transgenic for human FAD-PS1 mutations. Employing transgenic zebrafish carrying human FAD-PS1 mutations we will: (1) Determine phenotype of fluorescently tagged  FAD-PS1 expressing neurons in tgFAD-fish in vivo. (2)  Define in tgFAD-PS1 embryos a phenotypic read-out for use in genetic and chemical screens in tgFAD-PS1 embryos. (3) Carry out a dominant forward screen and an initial chemical screen on selected read-outs. The research entails concepts and techniques from genetics, neurobiology, embryology, cell biology and molecular biology

<p>Requirements: The candidate should have affinity with working on Alzheimer's disease. The self-motivated candidate should have a solid track record and proven capacity to independently and creatively carry out research.  He or she preferably has experience with molecular techniques and confocal microscopy.

<p>Duration: In principle the project is granted for two years but continuation into the second year is based on the satisfactory progress within the first year.

<p>Salary: According to "CAO-Nederlandse universiteiten" (CAO-NU): salary scale 10-11, depending on age and experience, excluding 8% holiday allowance and a year-end bonus.

<p>Location: Utrecht, The Netherlands.
