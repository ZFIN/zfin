<center><strong>(Stanford University, Stanford, CA)</strong></center><br>

<p>
We are seeking to fill a postdoctoral position with a project focus on zebrafish development in the Riedel-Kruse Lab, Bioengineering Department, Stanford. 

<p>We are fascinated by the emergent dynamics of biological systems - with one focus of our lab on understanding how genetic networks orchestrate the dynamics and mechanics of developing embryos. We take a physics approach by iterating between mathematical models and quantitative experiments. Zebrafish is particularly amenable to this approach due to its fast and external development, optical transparency, large number of eggs in a clutch needed for statistics, and the variety of genetic tools available. Our work will result in new quantitative methods to monitor and perturb these genetic networks, and we aim for conceptually deeper insights into key developmental principles such as the utility of entrained genetic oscillators and mechanical forces / motors for the patterning of a growing tissue. Please see Riedel-Kruse, I.H., Muller, C., and Oates, A.C.; Synchrony dynamics during initiation, failure and rescue of the segmentation clock. Science (2007) 317: 1911; or visit our website at <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/riedel-kruse/">http://www.stanford.edu/group/riedel-kruse/</a>

<p>This position offers the interdisciplinary advantages of Stanford in general, and the Bioengineering and Developmental Biology departments, in particular. Multiple groups working on Zebrafish provide a vibrant and interactive community; the embedding of our lab in the Bioengineering Department facilitates collaborations on many emerging technologies.

<p>You should be highly motivated and technically accomplished as documented by an exceptional publication record. The ideal candidate will have demonstrated experience with vertebrate developmental model systems and a strong background in molecular biology. Prior experience with zebrafish is desired, but not essential. Experience with computational and theoretical approaches would be a plus, but are not explicitly required - and this position particularly offers the opportunity to develop and strengthen this skill set within our interdisciplinary environment. Most of all, we value curiosity, creativity, and a pleasant personality.

<p>Please email CV incl. a list of relevant publications to the contact information below. Applicants accepted for initial consideration will be subsequently contacted for letters of reference. Please also mention whether you plan to travel to the bay area in the near future, or plan to attend relevant meetings (especially the Zebrafish meeting in Madison, June 16th-20th).

Multiple postdoctoral positions are currently open in the Lawson Laboratory in the Program in Gene Function and Expression, University of Massachusetts Medical School.

<p>Generation of novel zebrafish gene knock-out models for the study of angiogenesis.
A postdoctoral position is available to apply zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) technology to generate zebrafish knock-out models related to blood vessel development. This position will provide a unique opportunity to exploit and further develop ZFN technology in zebrafish as part of an ongoing collaborative effort between the neighboring laboratories of Drs. Nathan Lawson and Scot Wolfe. This effort will provide the successful applicant with the opportunity to master modular- and selection-based systems used to generate and evaluate site-specific ZFNs. The genetic models developed in the context of these studies will be used to address questions of interest relating to endothelial cell differentiation and angiogenesis. Particular emphasis will be on the application of ZFNs in the context of a reverse genetic screen to interrogate novel regulators of vascular development, as well as development of zebrafish models for vascular disease.


<p>Studying blood vessel formation and function using the zebrafish as a model system.
A postdoctoral position is available to utilize the zebrafish as a model system to study blood vessel development. Areas of particular interest include the following: transcriptional regulatory networks required for endothelial specification and blood vessel identity, the role of Notch signaling during vascular development, how mechanosensory inputs are integrated with developmental signaling pathways during blood vessel morphogenesis, and the role of microRNAs in vascular development. We take full advantage of the many benefits of the zebrafish model including the application of in vivo imaging by 2-photon microscopy, genetic manipulation through the use of zinc finger nucleases, and development of transgenic sensor lines for visualizing signaling outputs in vivo.

<p>
A postdoctoral research position is available immediately at the Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah in the laboratory of Dr. Cicely Jette.  In my lab, we use the forward genetic capacity of the zebrafish model system to identify novel genes required to protect cells from DNA damage. The proteins encoded by these genes are potential therapeutic targets whose inactivation will re-sensitize cancer cells that have become resistant to DNA-damage-inducing therapies. To this end, we have identified a number of zebrafish lines harboring ENU-induced mutations in novel radioprotective genes.  Current projects involve dissecting the functions of these genes through 1) genetic epistasis analysis in zebrafish embryos, 2) biochemical analysis in mammalian cell culture and 3) analysis of therapeutic potential using a zebrafish model of radioresistant T-cell leukemia.

<p>
The "Biology of Ageing" Laboratory (A. Cellerino, SNS Pisa, Italy) at the Leibniz Institute for Age Research, Fritz-Lipmann-Institute, Jena, Germany is inviting applications for a
 Postdoctoral position (TV-L E13)

<p>Identification of physiological and molecular mechanisms controlling aging 
in the short-lived fish Nothobranchius furzeri 

<p>Investigations into ageing in vertebrates is hampered by the absence of animals models with very short life span. In addition, very little information is available as to the genes controlling ageing and age-related dysfunctions in natural populations, due to lack of model systems where differences in aging phenotypes among natural populations are well-described. In the last years, we have established the annual fish Nothobranchius furzeri as a new model system for age research. The captive life span of this fish is only few months and it shows a greatly accelerated expression of typical age-related markers and these can be modulated by treatments known to increase lifespan in other model organisms. Populations of the short-lived fish Nothobranchius furzeri show large differences in lifespan and onset of age-related pathologies. 
Our main areas of research are: (1) Testing of life-extending interventions, (2) Identification of biological/molecular differences which correlate with differences in natural lifespan. 
Projects are conducted in strict collaboration with the groups Molecular Biology (Englert) and Genome Analysis (Platzer) within a "Nothobranchius project" at FLI.
