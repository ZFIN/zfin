<p>A postdoctoral position is available immediately to study the effects of small molecule modulators of Wnt signaling on zebrafish development. Our laboratory has utilized small molecule modulators to dissect the complex effects of Wnt signaling on both differentiation and proliferation (Teo et al. PNAS 2005, Miyabayashi et al. PNAS in press 2007).  In preliminary studies, some of these compounds also exhibit dramatic effects on zebrafish development. The goal of this project is to utilize these small molecule modulators to dissect the differential roles of Wnt signaling on zebrafish development.

 

<p>Successful candidates will be self-motivated and have a strong commitment to basic research. A Ph.D. in Molecular or Development Biology, Genetics, Biochemistry, or a related field is required. Expertise in Developmental/Molecular Biology and experience utilizing zebrafish as a model system is required.

<p>My lab is part of the University of Bath Centre for Regenerative Medicine (CRM). The CRM was recently successful in bidding for Marie Curie funds for short term visits by PhD students. Visits can range from 3 months to12 months in duration. It is envisaged that these fellowships will provide a key mechanism to develop and/or cement relationships with external laboratories. As such, I hope that you might all like to consider this as a potential opportunity to promote collaboration between our labs and I invite you to propose yourself or your students as a possible Marie Curie student visitor.

<p>There are some restrictions on eligibility for visitor places, including:</p>


<blockquote>
<br>Visits will only be accepted from applicants who are registered on a PhD at another institution outside the UK
<br>The work done in Bath will form part of the thesis submitted in the home institution
<br>The application will have the support of the supervisor(s) in the home institution
<br>Although visits can be from 3 months to one year, preference will usually
be given to longer stays (to maximise potential benefits)
</blockquote>

<p>Application will be considered and approved by the Management Team
of the CRM.

<p>Contact me in the first instance, to discuss project ideas, etc. If we decide to proceed we will then need:

<blockquote>
<br>1. A CV (including contact details for 2 referees, one of these will usually be their current supervisor) of the student
<br>2. A description of the project they are working on

<p>A position is available within a group which works on the neurobiology of modulatory neurontransmitter systems in vertebrates, including zebrafish. The general research questions in the laboratory are related to organization and mode of action of aminergic and peptidergic systems in normal and diseased brain. This particular project involves application of high-resolution 3D imaging systems on brain aminergic and peptidergic systems in zebrafish brain of normal and mutated fish, and development of a live imaging system of neurons to study the mode of function of modulatory transmitters, especially histamine. Fish from mutation screens will also be analysed to find abnormalities in important neuronal systems using confocal and two-photon microscopes. The instrumentation includes fully equipped confocal/2P microscopes (Leica SP2 AOBS). The group has equipment for quantitative behavioural and molecular analyses of the fish (e.g. quantitative PCR, protein chemistry, HPLC). Microinjection systems are used for translation inhibition and generation of transgenic fish. The laboratories are located in the Neuroscience Center, Institute of Biomedicine/Anatomy, Biomedicum Helsinki. An ideal candidate has a PhD and thorough training in advanced microscopic methods, image analysis and neurobiology.  High motivation and good communication skills are important.
 
<p>Salary will be negotiated according to qualifications based on the new governmental salary system. Initial appointment for a qualified postdoctoral candidate can be made for one year, and extended at maximum for the full four-year funding period.

<p>Immediate postdoctoral positions are available in the laboratory of Dr. Pamela C. Yelick, at Tufts University, Boston MA, to perform molecular genetic analyses of craniofacial and tooth development and regeneration in the zebrafish.  Gene discovery efforts in the zebrafish nicely compliment our whole tooth tissue engineering studies, which use mammalian dental stem cells for tooth regeneration applications.  The research includes mutagenesis screens for replacement tooth mutants, gene mapping, and functional characterization of cloned genes.  This laboratory also focuses on characterizing the functions of alk8, a novel type I TGFb family member receptor identified by this laboratory, in neural crest cell specification, and primary and replacement tooth formation.  A PhD in developmental biology/genetics, familiarity with zebrafish development, and superb laboratory skills are preferred.  The newly renovated laboratory and 2,000 tank zebrafish facility are located at Tufts Medical School, adjacent to the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, which consists of nine basic biomedical research programs.  Supervision of Sackler School graduate students will also be expected.  Interested applicants should submit a statement of research interests, curriculum vitae, and complete contact information for three references to Dr. Pamela C. Yelick (email preferable).  Tufts University is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action employer. </p>

<p><center><strong>(Center for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine at USC, Los Angeles, CA)</strong></center></p><br>
<p>A postdoctoral position is available in the lab of Dr. Gage Crump. The broad goal of the lab is to understand, at the molecular and cellular level, how organs acquire precise three-dimensional shapes. To this aim, we study the larval zebrafish head skeleton, where positional information and local epithelial signaling centers interact to shape a small set of unique cartilages. We use a wide range of techniques that include forward genetics, high-resolution time-lapse imaging, and transplantation.
 
<p>Current projects in the lab include the following:
 
<p>1.)  Understanding how positional information translates into skeletal shape by characterizing a set of new mutants with A-P and D-V patterning defects.
 
<p>2.)  Development of the pharyngeal endodermal epithelium and how the endoderm in turn induces local shaping of the head skeleton.
 
<p>3.)  Using developmental knowledge to regenerate cartilages and bones of specific shapes.
 
<p>Additional information can be found at <a href="http://www.usc.edu/programs/pibbs/site/faculty/crump_g.htm">http://www.usc.edu/programs/pibbs/site/faculty/crump_g.htm</a>.  
 
<p>Applicants must possess a Ph.D. in the biological sciences and should be self-motivated, creative, and willing to work in a multidisciplinary environment. Previous experience in zebrafish is not required.

<p>A postdoctoral position is available at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, to study vascular development in the zebrafish. The laboratory uses molecular, cellular, genetic, and transgenic approaches to study the specification, patterning and differentiation of the developing vascular system.  Some of our current areas of research interest include: understanding how blood vessels are specified and differentiate as arteries or veins; understanding how vessels assemble into reproducibly patterned neworks, and what cues guide this patterning; studying how endothelial cells undergo morphogenesis into tubular vessels in vivo using high-resolution mutiphoton imaging and experimental manipulation; isolating novel vascular-specific mutants and studying the molecular basis for their defects.  Scientific environment, resources, and stipend support are superb.
