Professor of Animal Developmental Biology at the Department of Organismal Biology, Evolutionary Biology Centre
<p>
See below for the official declaration of an open position as full professor in Animal Developmental Biology at Uppsala University. I would like to point out that the environment for this prestigious chair professor is ideal for a group interested in the zebrafish model system of two main reasons not mentioned in the text below:
<p>
1) A zebrafish developmental biology platform is already established within the SciLifeLab framework at the department and a further expansion for the full professors needs is possible. <a href="http://www.scilifelab.uu.se/Technology_Platforms/Comparative_genetics/Zebrafish_Model_System/">http://www.scilifelab.uu.se/Technology_Platforms/Comparative_genetics/Zebrafish_Model_System/</a> A close collaboration between the platform and the new professor would benefit everyone.
<p>
2) The department is now investing heavily in state-of-the-art microscopy equipment (e.g.  confocal microscopy, electron microscopy).
<p>
Please don’t hesitate to contact me for further information,
<p>
Sincerely Johan Ledin (<a href="mailto:johan.ledin@ebc.uu.se">johan.ledin@ebc.uu.se</a>)  Assistant professor / Manager SciLifeLab Uppsala zebrafish platform

<p>
Uppsala University hereby declares the following position to be open for applications:
<p>
 Professor of Animal Developmental Biology at the Department of Organismal Biology, Evolutionary Biology Centre 
<p>
The Department of Organismal Biology has a broad research spectrum with particular strengths in early vertebrate evolution, comparative animal physiology, developmental biology of mammals, developmental toxicology of the vertebrate brain and reproductive system, systematics, plant physiology, and the molecular evolution of prokaryotes. We are interested in strong candidates with research interests in vertebrates. However, we regard the quality of the research as more important than the specific subject.
<p>
Duties: Overall responsibility for research and research training within the subject area of animal development, supervision and training of research students, and teaching at undergraduate and advanced levels. Own research. Outreach connected with research and development work, and participation in the planning of research projects. In the longer term you may be expected to take on leadership roles within the department, such as Head of Research Programme ("programansvarig") and Head of Department ("prefekt").
<p>
Qualifications required: According to Chap. 4, and 5 of the Swedish Higher Education Ordinance the eligibility criteria for employment as professor are scientific as well as pedagogic proficiency. According to the appointment regulations of Uppsala University, it is also a general requirement that teachers have any other skills which are necessary to carry out their duties proficiently. According to the regulations, the scientific proficiency should be demonstrated through independent research that significantly exceeds the qualifications required for the Swedish title of "docent". Planning and leadership competence is important. The applicant must have the teaching proficiency required for the position and in addition, unless there are special reasons, formal pedagogical training relevant for the tasks associated with this position. The assessment of pedagogical proficiency will comprise planning, carrying out and evaluation of teaching as well as supervision and examination
<p>
The ability to teach in Swedish or English is a requirement. The holder is expected to be able to teach in Swedish within two years.
<p>
Selection criteria: The appointment of the Professor will be made principally on the basis of scientific and pedagogical skill, with the greatest emphasis placed on scientific skill. However, the criteria will be weighed against each other such that a candidate who is judged to have greatly superior pedagogical skills may be ranked ahead of another who is judged to be slightly superior scientifically.
<p>
The pedagogical and scientific skills of the candidates will be assessed with equal care. Research experience in developmental biology will be the principal criterion for assessing scientific skill. Pedagogical skill will be assessed with reference to experience of planning, execution and evaluation of teaching, as well as supervision of students and examination. For further information see Guidelines for appointment of teachers, chap. 7, Guidelines for the evaluation of qualifications when appointing teachers. 
<p>
Other proficiencies: Administrative proficiency is important and will be considered (as will suitability for and interest in leadership). Ability to cooperate with the surrounding society and to inform the public about research and development work will also be considered.
<p>
Selection criteria; other skills: As the position may come to include duties such as Head of research Programme or Head of Department, substantial emphasis will be placed on leadership ability and interest.
<p>
Administration skills are demonstrated through ability in overall operational planning, ability to organise and lead personnel and ability to cooperate. Ability to inform the public about research and development work is demonstrated by popular scientific activities, for example participating in extramural education, publishing popular scientific papers and participating in public discussions on topics of education and research.
<p>
Personal circumstances (such as parental leave) that may benefit applicants in the assessment of qualifications, should be included in the list of qualifications and experience (CV).
<p>
In filling this position the university aims to recruit the person who, in the combined evaluation of documented qualifications, competence and skills is judged the most suitable to carry out and develop the work-in-hand and to contribute to a positive development of the group and the department.
<p>
Uppsala University is striving for a more even gender balance in its research and teaching staff. Since most professors of the Faculty are men, women are especially invited to apply for this position.
<p>

Elongation in mouse and zebrafish: in vivo and in silico analyses of cell behaviours
<p>
Two positions for enthusiastic scientists (post-doctoral fellows or researchers holding a permanent position) are available in the laboratory of JF. Nicolas in the Department of Developmental Biology, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France. The equivalent of 2-year post-doctoral funding, available between January 2011 and December 2013, is provided by an ANR grant.
<p>
The research projects focus on embryo elongation in zebrafish and mouse and the relative contributions of distinct cell behaviours (cell rearrangements, division orientation and modes of growth of precursor pools) to this process. They involve two large-scale approaches, in vivo retrospective clonal analysis and 4D imaging and in silico cell tracking. We propose to understand whether the embryo uses distinct cell-based developmental modules to elongate during successive developmental phases that are heterogeneous in modalities. The comparison of this study with that conducted in the laboratory in amphioxus should allow us to develop an evolutionary perspective on embryo elongation.
<p>
The Developmental Biology department at Institut Pasteur provides a highly stimulating and interactive scientific environment, state of the art facilities dedicated to imaging and image analysis, genomics and proteomics and an active programme of seminars (<a href="http://www.pasteur.fr/recherche/departements/DepBiodev/home.html">http://www.pasteur.fr/recherche/departements/DepBiodev/home.html</a>).
<p>
Candidates holding a PhD with a strong background in Molecular Biology and Developmental Biology are encouraged to apply. Experience in zebrafish or mouse genetics is preferred but not required.
<p>
Candidates interested in this position should send a covering letter stating why they are interested in the position, a full CV with bibliography and details of at least two referees to Dr. E. Hirsinger and Pr. JF. Nicolas at the addresses below. Only short-listed applicants will be contacted. Interviews will take place in January 2011.

<center><strong>(The Saint Louis Institute)</strong></center><br>

<p>The Saint Louis Institute (SLI) in the heart of Paris has initiated a large focused renewal process to become a leading centre for personalised medicine in onco/haematology.  This includes building and refurbishing of new lab space of 4700 m2 that will take place under a four year time period. We will establish a research infrastructure that is based on strong clinical and pre-clinical research and supported by extensive platforms in protein chemistry, medicinal and in silico chemistry, imaging and translational research.  We will strengthen existing research but also establish new teams.  With respect to the latter, we will start to recruit new teams in 2011.  In the first instance we are interested in a young team to establish his/her own research program using existing zebrafish facilities.  We are interested in groups who will develop zebrafish model systems to study cell biological pathways implicated in the patophysiology of onco/haematological disorders.  The French research organisations Inserm and CNRS have a 5 year program (Avenir/Atip) that is designed to get young scientists started in France.  At the end of, or during this period, the chances are good to secure a tenure research-only position within these organisations.  Start-up packages from the SLI will also be made available.

<h2 align="center"><font color="#004080" size="5"><a name="lang">Postdoctoral Positions</a></font></h2>

<center><strong>(Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School)</strong></center><br>

<p>
Postdoctoral positions are available in the laboratory of Dr. David Langenau in the Department of Molecular Pathology at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School.  Dr. Langenau's research focus is to uncover self-renewal mechanisms associated with relapse pediatric cancer (<a href="http://langenaulab.com/">langenaulab.com</a>). 

 
<p>
The laboratory uses transgenic zebrafish models of cancer, cross-species bioinformatic approaches, chemical genetic and traditional genetic approaches to discover how it is that tumors can be remade following conventional chemotherapeutic intervention.  Projects center on using live cell imaging to visualize tumor development in fluorescent-labeled zebrafish solid tumors and leukemia. Additionally, high throughput cell transplantation of tumor cells and cross-species array profiling will be utilized to study conserved genetic programs that alter self-renewal and are responsible for maintenance of cancer stem cells.  Human cancer ell lines and tissues are also used to validate pathways found in zebrafish cancer for their roles in human disease.

 
<p>
Candidates must have a Ph.D. and/or  M.D, or equivalent.  Priority will be given to qualified candidates with a strong background in zebrafish genetics, developmental biology, and/or cancer-related research.  Competitive applicants will have a proven track record in terms of publications and independent funding.

 
<p>
If interested, please send a resume and 3 references of contact to Dr. David Langenau at <a href="mailto:dlangenau@partners.org">dlangenau@partners.org</a>.  Positions are available beginning January 2011.

<center><strong>(University of London)</strong></center><br>

<p>
We are seeking a highly motivated Postdoctoral Research Assistant to join Dr Caroline Brennan on a project entitled 'Developing behavioural assays in zebrafish to identify genetic mechanisms underlying drug seeking and vulnerability to drug abuse'.
<p>
Drug abuse is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the UK and US. Relapse, the return to drug taking following extended periods of abstinence, is a characteristic of addiction and remains a major problem for its treatment (Stewart, J. Review, Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci, 2008. 363(1507): p. 3147-58).  While much is known of the pathophysiology associated with drug abuse, relatively little is known of developmental and molecular mechanisms that underlie differences in individual propensity for drug seeking and the likelihood of relapse. Here we aim to develop behavioural assays of drug seeking in zebrafish and use these to identify developmental and genetic mechanisms contributing to propensity for compulsive drug seeking and return to drug taking following abstinence, critical aspects of drug addiction. 
<p>
This is a full-time, fixed term post available for 3 years.  The starting salary will be &#163;33,659 per annum.  The post is funded by the Medical Research Council's National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (<a href="http://nc3rs.tnllive.co.uk">http://nc3rs.tnllive.co.uk</a>).  The salary is inclusive of London allowance. Benefits include 30 days annual leave, final salary pension scheme and an interest-free season ticket loan.
<p>
The successful applicant will have experience of behavioural analysis in rodent or other model species.  Knowledge of reward pathways or of zebrafish as a model system is desirable but not essential. 
<p>
Candidates must be able to demonstrate their eligibility to work in the UK in accordance with the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006. Where required this may include entry clearance or continued leave to remain under the Points Based Immigration Scheme.
<p>
Informal enquiries should be addressed to Dr Caroline Brennan (<a href="mailto:c.h.brennan@qmul.ac.uk">c.h.brennan@qmul.ac.uk</a> tel: 020 7882 3011).
