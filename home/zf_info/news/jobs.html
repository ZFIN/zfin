<p><center><strong>(Syracuse University)</strong></center></p><br>
<p>Albertson Lab, Department of Biology, Syracuse University

<p>We are looking for exceptional students interested in studying the evolution of developmental mechanisms. Ph.D. positions are available for Fall 2008. Funding is guaranteed through teaching assistantships, with additional funding (i.e., research assistantships) pending.  Successful applicants will be able to participate in a variety of ongoing and future projects aimed at understanding the evolution of skeletal patterning. Several vertebrate taxa are currently being studied in the lab, including zebrafish, African cichlids and Antarctic icefishes.  The approach of the lab is to integrate studies in a laboratory model (i.e., zebrafish) and natural populations (i.e., cichlids) to understand the evolution of animal form and function. Methods of study include comparative embryology, developmental and molecular genetics, quantitative genetics, and morphometric shape analysis.

<p>For more information about specific projects in the lab please visit my website at <a href="http://albertsonlab.syr.edu/research.html">http://albertsonlab.syr.edu/research.html.</a>

<p>Faculty in the Biology Department at Syracuse University have a broad array of interests ranging from molecular, cellular and developmental biology to ecology and evolution. Furthermore, the close proximity of SU to several other excellent institutions including SUNY Environmental Science and Forestry, SUNY Upstate Medical Center, Cornell University and the University of Rochester, contributes to a strong and vibrant intellectual community that will facilitate a great graduate experience.   

<p>All prospective students are encouraged to contact Dr. Craig Albertson via e-mail (<a href=mailto:rcalbert@syr.edu>rcalbert@syr.edu</a>) and to complete a free on-line pre-application form available at <a href="http://biology.syr.edu/graduatestudies/graduatepreapp.html">http://biology.syr.edu/graduatestudies/graduatepreapp.html</a>

<p>For Fall 2008 admittance, formal graduate applications should be received in early January 2008.

<p><center><strong>(The University of Miami at Coral Gables)</strong></center></p><br>
<p>As part of a significant expansion, the Department of Biology seeks a tenure-track faculty candidate in Developmental Biology who uses non-mammalian model genetic organisms such as zebrafish to investigate fundamental problems.  The preferred candidate will be able to interface with the broader research community that has strong foci in neuroscience, evolution, and ecology.  Application review will begin by October 1 2007 and will continue until the position is filled. The successful candidates will be expected to maintain innovative, externally funded research and to teach graduate and undergraduate students.  Nine months of salary is guaranteed.  Ph.D. and postdoctoral work is required.  Send a curriculum vitae, representative reprints, statements of research and teaching interests, and have three letters of reference sent to <a href=mailto:BioSearch@bio.miami.edu>BioSearch@bio.miami.edu</a></p>
<p>Under its new leadership, the UM Department of Biology is building a robust research community designed to successfully integrate distinctly disparate research cultures. This unique community will rest on a foundational tripod of three disciplines: Developmental Biology, Ecology and Evolution.  These foundations will be bridged by researchers who embody exciting intersections among disciplines: "Evo-Devo" (the intersect of evolution and development), "Eco-Evo" (the intersect of ecology and evolution) and "Eco-Devo" (the intersect of ecology and development).  At the pinnacle, Genomics intersects with all the disciplines.  This structure supports an integrated network of interactions that foster outstanding research. Please view our new <a href=http://www.bio.miami.edu/index.html>website</a>.</p>
<p>Two zebrafish researchers were recruited last year, Julia Dallman and Isaac Skromne, and we are constructing a new zebrafish facility with a capacity for twenty fish racks. Two senior developmental biologists were also recruited, Akira Chiba, a Developmental Neuroscientist working with Drosophila  and Athula Wikramanayake, an Evo-Devo researcher working with urchin and anemone. Additional positions are anticipated in coming years.</p>

<br>Department of Biological Sciences

<p>An NIH-funded postdoctoral position in the Department of Biological
Sciences, The University of Pittsburgh, is available immediately to study
vascular development using the zebrafish as a model system.  Our laboratory
employs a diverse array of molecular, biochemical, imaging, and
embryological techniques to elucidate genetic pathways that control vascular
development.   Specifically, we are interested in the role of the TGF-beta
type I receptor, ALK1, in vascular development and disease.  ALK1 function
is critical in vascular development and homeostasis: homozygous ALK1
mutations are embryonic lethal, whereas the heterozygous condition results
in the autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia, Hereditary Hemorrhagic
Telangiectasia Type II (HHT2).  Our laboratory is interested in
investigating the regulation of alk1 expression; identifying downstream
targets of Alk1 activation; and probing the cellular role of Alk1 within the
endothelium.

<p>Our department is home to an interactive group of Developmental Biologists
studying a variety of developmental processes in zebrafish, Drosophila,
mouse, and C. elegans.  Our laboratory is also part of an active and growing
zebrafish community on the greater University of Pittsburgh campus, as well
as the campus-wide Center for Vascular Remodeling and Regeneration

<p>Diversity of sex determination in fish: functional genetic analysis of sex chromosomes in the platyfish Xiphophorus maculatus.

<p><b>Description of the project</b><br>
In contrast to the situation observed in mammals and birds, sex determination is hypervariable and evolves extremely rapidly in fish. This variability is potentially associated with the formation of new master sex-determining genes and new sex chromosomes. Hence, fish represent an outstanding model for the study of the evolution of sex determination, sex chromosomes and sex-linked traits.
Understanding the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms involved in the diversity of sex determination requires the identification of master genes controlling the sex of individuals. The only gene of this type identified so far in fish, dmrt1bY in the medaka, is present in only a restricted number of species. Due to the absence of recognizable sex chromosomes and sex-linked molecular markers, zebrafish and both pufferfishes Fugu and Tetraodon, with almost completely sequenced genomes, are not suitable for this type of analysis. Hence, new models are required to study sex determination in fish.

<p>The platyfish Xiphophorus maculatus is an aquarium fish reputed for its use in cancer research. Due to the availability of numerous molecular markers delimiting the sex-determining region, this species is particularly suitable to study the control of sexual dimorphism. Our major goal is to identify through positional cloning and to characterize at both functional and evolutionary levels the master sex-determining gene of the platyfish, as well as other sex chromosomal genes involved in pigmentation, sexual development and melanoma formation. Bacterial artificial chromosome contigs from both X and Y chromosomes have been already constructed and are being sequenced to completion in collaboration with the Genoscope sequencing center. The expression, function, genomic localization and evolution of the identified genes will be studied in platyfish and other fish models including killifish, medaka and zebrafish, as well as in guppies and mollies, which are important biological models closely related to the platyfish. This study has implications for cancer research through the identification of genes involved in the formation of melanoma, as well as for aquaculture, for which molecular sexing and manipulation of sex determination are important economical challenges.

<p><b>Candidat profile</b><br>
The candidate will analyse at the functional level the genes identified on the sex chromosomes of the platyfish. He/she should be highly motivated by research in the field of \"Evo/devo\" and be experienced in methods used in fish developmental biology. Knowledge in bioinformatics and molecular evolution would be of advantage. The candidate should be able to work autonomously and demonstrate interest in pluridisciplinary scientific interactions inside as well as outside of the institute.<br>
