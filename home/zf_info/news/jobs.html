<p>
<br>Postdoctoral Fellow, Zebrafish Vascular Development
<br>Department of Biological Sciences
<br>University of Pittsburgh


<p>An NIH-funded postdoctoral position in the Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Pittsburgh, is available immediately to study vascular development using the zebrafish as a model system.  Our laboratory employs a diverse array of molecular, biochemical, imaging, and embryological techniques to elucidate genetic pathways that control vascular development.   Specifically, we are interested in the role of the TGF-beta type I receptor, ALK1, in vascular development and disease.  ALK1 function is critical in vascular development and homeostasis: homozygous ALK1 mutations are embryonic lethal, whereas the heterozygous condition results in the autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia, Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia Type 2 (HHT2).  Our laboratory is interested in investigating the regulation of alk1 expression; identifying downstream targets of Alk1 activation; and probing the cellular role of Alk1 within the endothelium.

<p>Our department is home to an interactive group of Developmental Biologists studying a variety of developmental processes in zebrafish, Drosophila, mouse, and C. elegans. Our laboratory is also part of an active and growing zebrafish community on the University of Pittsburgh campus, as well as the campus-wide Center for Vascular Remodeling and Regeneration.
 
<p>Qualified candidates must have a PhD in a relevant field, and a strong publication record.  Interested candidates should send (1) a brief cover letter summarizing scientific accomplishments and stating future research goals; (2) a full CV; and (3) full contact information for three references to Beth Roman at <a href="mailto:romanb@pitt.edu">romanb@pitt.edu</a>.

<center><strong>(Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah )</strong></center><br>

<p>
A postdoctoral research position is available immediately at the Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah in the laboratory of Dr. Cicely Jette.  In my lab, we use the forward genetic capacity of the zebrafish model system to identify novel genes required to protect cells from DNA damage. The proteins encoded by these genes are potential therapeutic targets whose inactivation will re-sensitize cancer cells that have become resistant to DNA-damage-inducing therapies. To this end, we have identified a number of zebrafish lines harboring ENU-induced mutations in novel radioprotective genes.  Current projects involve dissecting the functions of these genes through 1) genetic epistasis analysis in zebrafish embryos, 2) biochemical analysis in mammalian cell culture and 3) analysis of therapeutic potential using a zebrafish model of radioresistant T-cell leukemia.  For more information, see: <a href="http://medicine.utah.edu/oncsci/faculty/cjette.htm">http://medicine.utah.edu/oncsci/faculty/cjette.htm</a>.
 
<p>The successful candidate must have an Ph.D. and/or M.D. or equivalent and should have experience in genetics and cell culture as demonstrated by significant first author publications.  Zebrafish experience is preferred, but not necessary.

The "Biology of Ageing" Laboratory (A. Cellerino, SNS Pisa, Italy) at the Leibniz Institute for Age Research, Fritz-Lipmann-Institute, Jena, Germany is inviting applications for a
 Postdoctoral position (TV-L E13)

<p>Identification of physiological and molecular mechanisms controlling aging 
in the short-lived fish Nothobranchius furzeri 

<p>Investigations into ageing in vertebrates is hampered by the absence of animals models with very short life span. In addition, very little information is available as to the genes controlling ageing and age-related dysfunctions in natural populations, due to lack of model systems where differences in aging phenotypes among natural populations are well-described. In the last years, we have established the annual fish Nothobranchius furzeri as a new model system for age research. The captive life span of this fish is only few months and it shows a greatly accelerated expression of typical age-related markers and these can be modulated by treatments known to increase lifespan in other model organisms. Populations of the short-lived fish Nothobranchius furzeri show large differences in lifespan and onset of age-related pathologies. 
Our main areas of research are: (1) Testing of life-extending interventions, (2) Identification of biological/molecular differences which correlate with differences in natural lifespan. 
Projects are conducted in strict collaboration with the groups Molecular Biology (Englert) and Genome Analysis (Platzer) within a "Nothobranchius project" at FLI.

<p>Further questions: <a href="mailto:acellerino@fli-leibniz.de">acellerino@fli-leibniz.de</a>

<p>We are looking for a candidate with a strong background in physiology/anatomy/pathology OR molecular biology OR evolutionary biology/behavioural studies with strong team capability, who wishes to contribute to a multidisciplinary project.  Previous experience with fish model systems is a plus, but not a prerequisite.

A highly motivated and ambitious PhD, MD, or MD/PhD scientist is sought to join the emerging field of chemical genetics. My laboratory has identified a number of small molecules that perturb zebrafish embryonic patterning. The first goal is to study how these small molecules function by identifying their cellular targets using cell biological and biochemical approaches. The second goal is to explore whether these small molecules promote development of specific cell and tissue types in pluripotent stem cell models. Lastly, since aberrant activities of many of developmental pathways are thought to play a major role in pathogenesis of variety of human diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases and anemia, an important goal is to explore therapeutic potential of chemical modulation of these pathways in various murine disease models. Toward the last goal, the candidate will be working closely with medicinal chemistry colleagues in the Vanderbilt Program for Drug Discovery.  The candidate must have good communication skills, experience in cell and molecular biology, and tissue culture techniques.  Experience in zebrafish embryology, zebrafish transgenic methods, drug target identification, protein biochemistry, mouse cancer models, and/or embryonic stem cells are a plus.

Applications are invited to join the research team of Professor Peter Cullen to study the role of phosphoinositides mediated membrane trafficking through the endocytic network during zebrafish development.

<p>With the increasing number of diseases linked to defects in the metabolism of endosomal phosphoinositides (e.g. neuropathies and myopathies), the laboratory aims to achieve a thorough mechanistic understanding of how phosphoinositides regulate endosomal function by identifying and characterizing specific phosphoinositide receptor proteins and their associated protein complexes. In doing so, we seek to generate new insight into the importance of endosomal phosphoinositides in health and disease (see Nat Cell Biol 9, 1370-1380 (2007), Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol 9, 574 (2008); Dev Cell 17, 110-122 (2009), <a href="http://www.bris.ac.uk/biochemistry/cullen/index.html">http://www.bris.ac.uk/biochemistry/cullen/index.html</a>).
