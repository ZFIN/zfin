<p>Postdoctoral Fellow, Zebrafish Vascular Development
<br>Department of Biological Sciences
<br>University of Pittsburgh


<p>An NIH-funded postdoctoral position in the Department of Biological
Sciences, The University of Pittsburgh, is available immediately to study
vascular development using the zebrafish as a model system.  Our laboratory
employs a diverse array of molecular, biochemical, imaging, and
embryological techniques to elucidate genetic pathways that control vascular
development.   Specifically, we are interested in the role of the TGF-beta
type I receptor, ALK1, in vascular development and disease.  ALK1 function
is critical in vascular development and homeostasis: homozygous ALK1
mutations are embryonic lethal, whereas the heterozygous condition results
in the autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia, Hereditary Hemorrhagic
Telangiectasia Type II (HHT2).  Our laboratory is interested in
investigating the regulation of alk1 expression; identifying downstream
targets of Alk1 activation; and probing the cellular role of Alk1 within the
endothelium.

<p>Our department is home to an interactive group of Developmental Biologists
studying a variety of developmental processes in zebrafish, Drosophila,
mouse, and C. elegans.  Our laboratory is also part of an active and growing
zebrafish community on the greater University of Pittsburgh campus, as well
as the campus-wide Center for Vascular Remodeling and Regeneration
(http://www.surgery.upmc.edu/CVRR/)
 
<p>Qualified candidates must have a PhD in a biological science and less than 3
years post-doctoral experience; expertise in Molecular Biology; and a strong
publication record.  Developmental Biology and/or Cell Biology experience is
preferred.  Interested candidates should send (1) a brief cover letter
summarizing scientific accomplishments and stating future research goals;
(2) a full CV; and (3) full contact information for three references to

<p>CENTRE FOR CARBOHYDRATE RECOGNITION AND SIGNALLING

 

<p>Postdoc position on the molecular genetics of zebrafish genes encoding LysM containing proteins and function of the LysM domains in carbohydrate recognition.

 

<p>The postdoc position is open on a joint project between Prof. Herman Spaink Leiden University, The Netherlands and Prof. Jens Stougaard University of Aarhus, Denmark. The postdoc will have activities in Aarhus and Leiden and should be prepared to relocate between the two universities for longer periods of time.

 

<p>This project aimed at characterizing zebrafish-microbe interactions will make use of advanced micro-array analyses and morpholino gene knockdown technologies.

 

<p>Appointment is initially for 3 years with a possibility for extension up to five years. The successful applicant will therefore have the opportunity to build a zebrafish group at University of Aarhus and establish collaborations with colleges in the molecular biology and medical departments.    

 

<p>The postdoctoral position is part of a research centre initiative funded by the National Danish Research Foundation for five years. Centre for Carbohydrate Recognition and Signalling will focus on interdisciplinary approaches for understanding biological recognition and response processes at the molecular level. Carbohydrate signals and extracellular polysaccharides play an important role in cell-to-cell communication processes and are equally important for organisation of multicellular organisms and the development of their specialised organs and tissues. The Centre will undertake an integrated functional characterisation of receptor-ligand mechanisms mediating recognition of surface-exposed polysaccharides and subsequent signal amplification. Experimental approaches from chemical biology, bioinformatics, structural biology, functional genomics, proteomics, bioorganic chemistry, and nanobioscience tools will be used in an interdisciplinary environment combining experience from laboratories with complementary research expertise. Centre activities will focus on two model organisms, zebrafish and the legume plant Lotus japonicus, and their interactions with pathogenic and symbiotic microorganisms.

<p>Diversity of sex determination in fish: functional genetic analysis of sex chromosomes in the platyfish Xiphophorus maculatus.

<p><b>Description of the project</b><br>
In contrast to the situation observed in mammals and birds, sex determination is hypervariable and evolves extremely rapidly in fish. This variability is potentially associated with the formation of new master sex-determining genes and new sex chromosomes. Hence, fish represent an outstanding model for the study of the evolution of sex determination, sex chromosomes and sex-linked traits.
Understanding the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms involved in the diversity of sex determination requires the identification of master genes controlling the sex of individuals. The only gene of this type identified so far in fish, dmrt1bY in the medaka, is present in only a restricted number of species. Due to the absence of recognizable sex chromosomes and sex-linked molecular markers, zebrafish and both pufferfishes Fugu and Tetraodon, with almost completely sequenced genomes, are not suitable for this type of analysis. Hence, new models are required to study sex determination in fish.

<p>The platyfish Xiphophorus maculatus is an aquarium fish reputed for its use in cancer research. Due to the availability of numerous molecular markers delimiting the sex-determining region, this species is particularly suitable to study the control of sexual dimorphism. Our major goal is to identify through positional cloning and to characterize at both functional and evolutionary levels the master sex-determining gene of the platyfish, as well as other sex chromosomal genes involved in pigmentation, sexual development and melanoma formation. Bacterial artificial chromosome contigs from both X and Y chromosomes have been already constructed and are being sequenced to completion in collaboration with the Genoscope sequencing center. The expression, function, genomic localization and evolution of the identified genes will be studied in platyfish and other fish models including killifish, medaka and zebrafish, as well as in guppies and mollies, which are important biological models closely related to the platyfish. This study has implications for cancer research through the identification of genes involved in the formation of melanoma, as well as for aquaculture, for which molecular sexing and manipulation of sex determination are important economical challenges.

<p><b>Candidat profile</b><br>
The candidate will analyse at the functional level the genes identified on the sex chromosomes of the platyfish. He/she should be highly motivated by research in the field of \"Evo/devo\" and be experienced in methods used in fish developmental biology. Knowledge in bioinformatics and molecular evolution would be of advantage. The candidate should be able to work autonomously and demonstrate interest in pluridisciplinary scientific interactions inside as well as outside of the institute.<br>
