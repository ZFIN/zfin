progress.

<p>The LIRANS Institute of Research in the Applied Natural Sciences is an
established Research Institute of the University presently consisting of
14 senior research staff, 7 PhD students and 8 visiting professors and
fellows. Research students will join this multi-disciplinary team, who
are engaged in strategic and applied research, and postgraduate
training, in the areas of cryobiology, sensor technology, measurement
science, process control and environmental monitoring.

<p>The Institute is located in a new, dedicated facility in the
Butterfield Science and Business Park in Luton, and benefits from
*state of the art* laboratory facilities and excellent staff
accommodation.

<p>Nature and Scope: 	Cryobiology is a major theme within the
Institute, which attracts external research funding from research
councils, charities and industry, and offers research degree programmes
for MSc (Research) and PhD.

<p>Cryobiology research at LIRANS is exploring the impact of
cryo-protocols on a range of biological material.  The Institute*s
main themes have been the cryo-preservation of gametes, embryos and
embryonic cells of the zebrafish, an important model species in
developmental biology and genetics.

<p>In addition to staff research and research degree programmes, LIRANS
also runs a taught masters course - MSc Biotechnology -  which
incorporates three main themes: Cell and Molecular Biology; Cryobiology;
and Analytical and Diagnostic Technology.  Students also undertake a
dissertation and research project linked to one of the themes.  

<p>Project 1:  Development and cryopreservation of fish stem cell lines

<p>The project seeks to develop techniques for cryopreservation of fish
stem cells. The investigation will include studies on isolation and
culture of fish embryonic cells, development of cryopreservation
protocols for these cells and studies on the effect of cryopreservation
on stability and genetic integrity of these cells.


<p>Project 2: Cryo-impact on fibroblasts and iPS stem cells

<p>The research will be undertaken on cell lines derived from zebrafish
tissue explants.  This will include transformed somatic cell lines to
iPS cells - stem cell like, pleuripotent cells - by viral vector
vectors.  Whilst cryopreservation of many cell types has been
successfully achieved, there is a growing concern that subtle impacts
may be induced during the cryo-treatment which do not result in a loss
of viability but may have long-term implications in certain applications
- for example stem cell therapy.  The proposed programme will seek to
identify possible effects of cryo-treatment and to develop protocols
that reduce damaging impacts.

<p>Principal Accountabilities

<p>1.	To develop a personal area of research study as a programme for
registration the degree of MPhil with transfer to PhD.
<br>2.	To undertake a programme of research into either the development
and cryopreservation of fish stem cell lines or the impact of
cryo-protocols on cellular physiology and biochemistry, with particular
emphasis on mitochondrial activity.
<br>3.	To work as a member of the LIRANS team, and contribute to the
general activities of the Institute.

<p>General accountabilities
<br>1.	Maintenance of accurate and adequate records of work carried
out.
<br>2.	Generation and presentation of high quality reports and
publications.
<br>3.	Ensure a safe and professional working environment.
<br>4.	Assistance with general laboratory tasks to ensure the smooth
running of the Research Institute.

<p>Communication skills
The bursary holder must demonstrate good written and verbal
communication skills.

<p>Reliability
The bursary holder must establish an effective and efficient method of

<p>
A postdoctoral position is available from 1 Dec 2009 in a new neurobiology group working on the application of new genetically encoded neurotoxins in basic and clinical neuroscience using the zebrafish (Danio rerio). Our group actively develops transgenic methods to genetically identify interneurons in the intact spinal cord or midbrain that drive locomotion and goal-orientated motor behaviors. A major goal is to unravel the role of discrete neurons in specific behaviors by systematic silencing of neurons in vivo. By using Gal4/UAS or Cre/LoxP binary expression systems, we can target neurotoxins to small populations of neurons in the brain or spinal cord in vivo, and analyze the function of these neurons in sensory-motor behaviors using high-speed imaging and electrophysiology. Identified neurons and circuits are used in turn as paradigms for testing new genetically modified neurotoxins with potential neurotherapeutic value. There are several possible projects available, including the functional analysis of newly identified subclasses of spinal interneurons, dissection of midbrain circuits underlying prey capture behavior, and development of conditional or modified neurotoxins. Each of these projects allows the unique opportunity to combine transgenic, behavioral and electrophysiological approaches as well as live imaging to gain new insight into the development and function of neural circuits and behavior. 

<p>Applicants should have a PhD in a discipline related to the project and a strong interest in molecular genetics, development and neuroscience. Experience in molecular biology and biochemistry including DNA cloning and PCR is desired. Expertise in electrophysiology using model organisms would be a significant advantage.
The postdoctoral position is initially for 2 years with the possibility of extension. Salary starts at 436.800 NOK.

The laboratory has identified genes expressed in chondrocytes (see: Nature Genetics 2006 Oct;38(10):1198-203.) that are essential for craniofacial morphogenesis. The project will involve conducting genetic, molecular and biochemical analyses of protein trafficking in secretory cell types in zebrafish and in mammalian cells in culture.

<p>The successful candidate must be highly motivated to work independently and to interact with collaborators. Experience in cell imaging or protein biochemistry is essential, and background in developmental or cell biology are expected.  The salary is highly competitive and will commensurate with experience. Applicants must have a Ph.D. and or an M.D. awarded within the past 2 years.
