<p>BACKGROUND INFORMATION

<p>I will shortly be advertising an Assistant Professor / Research Associate position in vertebrate developmental biology at the Subdepartment of Evolutionary Organismal Biology, Department of Physiology and Developmental Biology, Uppsala University. The position is tenable for four years and is targeted principally to researchers who have completed their PhDs within the last five years. The advertisement will be appearing in Nature on 12 October 2006 and the deadline for applications is 30 November. It can also be found on the web at http://www.personalavd.uu.se/ledigaplatser/939forass_eng.html
 
<p>Note that although this is a fixed-term appointment, it is a pensionable salaried position not a research fellowship, and entitles the holder to benefits such as parental leave and paid sick leave.
 
<p>Profile of my lab and intended role of the Assistant Professor

<p>My lab works at the interface of morphological evolution and evolutionary developmental biology, with focus on major events in early vertebrate evolution - chiefly the origin of the gnathostome (jawed vertebrate) morphotype, the diversification of gnathostome morphologies, and the origin of tetrapods. Our recent publications in these areas include Developmental Biology 210, 1-14 (1999), Nature 410, 81-84 (2001), Nature 420, 760-761 (2002), Nature 425, 66-69 (2003), Nature 427, 412-413, Nature 432, 94-97 (2004), Nature 436, 347-355 (2005), Nature 437, 137-140 (2005), Nature 438, 1145-1147 (2005), Nature 439, 318-321 (2006) and Evolution and Development 8, 331-349 (2006). More information about our research can be found at <a href="http://www.fu.uu.se/eo">http://www.fu.uu.se/eo</a> and <a href="http://www.teknat.uu.se/forskning/program.php?vetenskapsid=1&id=172&typ=forskningsprogram&forskomr=3&lang=en&">http://www.teknat.uu.se/forskning/program.php?vetenskapsid=1&id=172&typ=forskningsprogram&forskomr=3&lang=en&</a>. The latter page also details the thematically related research on invertebrate evolution and development led by Dr Graham Budd of the Department of Earth Sciences (see below). (Please note that this link is occasionally tempermental.)
 
<p>Until now our developmental work has largely been carried out in collaboration with other labs (principally those of Georgy Koentges, UCL, London; Jean Joss, Macquarie University, Sydney; and Ferenc Mueller, Karlsruhe, Germany), though one of our current in-house projects is a comparative study of pelvic development in axolotl and Australian lungfish. However, our long-term aim is to build up the developmental side of our research profile in order to create a more fully integrated evolutionary-developmental research programme. The intention is to have young researchers with in-depth expertise in morphological evolution, palaeontology, phylogenetics and molecular developmental biology working closely alongside each other, exchanging ideas, and developing conceptually rigorous and technically realistic research projects addressing the evolution of morphology and underlying molecular patterning mechanisms.
 
<p>The Assistant Professor will take a lead role in building up the developmental research programme. A well-equipped developmental lab is already set up (see below) but the A.P. will have the opportunity to complement this with specific equipment purchases necessary for his/her research. If required, the A.P. will also set up a colony of his/her study animals. At present the Department houses a Xenopus tropicalis colony which can be expanded if necessary, and infrastructure exists for setting up fish and/or salamander colonies. We have been offered the opportunity to obtain lamprey eggs from a nearby Swedish Board of Fisheries research station. There are also possibilities to keep mammals and birds.
 
<p>In order to complement our research profile we will be particularly interested in candidates whose research deals with lower vertebrates (fish and amphibians) and has relevance to morphogenetic questions. However, our main priority is to appoint a researcher with extensive hands-on experience of molecular techniques. Whatever their specific profile, we would expect the Assistant Professor to take an interest in the evolutionary research of the lab and contribute actively to the framing of evolutionary-developmental research projects as set out above.
 
<p>Equipment, funding
The following equipment is currently available in our lab:
Large platform shaker, gyro twister, two digital dry baths (block incubators), two PCR machines (one of which is being upgraded to a gradient PCR), centrifuge, two test-tube agitators, incubator, two fridges, two freezers, pH meter, two magnetic shakers/warm plates, three microscopes with lights (two dissecting, one slide), microwave,  centrifuge, scale, equipment for gels.
 
<p>We also have access to the following equipment belonging to the Developmental Biology research group:
Millipore machine, gel doc (gel visualization machine), wet autoclave, dark room for ethidium bromide and SYBR green work, space in -40C freezers.
 
<p>Confocal and electron microscopes are available for our use and are located conveniently close to the lab.
 
<p>Funding is available for the purchase of additional equipment and for research running costs during the first year of appointment. However, the Assistant Professor is expected to apply for external funding to support his/her continuing work.
 
<p>Social and academic environment
We are located in the Evolutionary Biology Centre of Uppsala University, a strong research constellation that you can explore through our website http://www.ebc.uu.se/index_eng.php. Our immediate neigbours in the Department of Physiology and Developmental Biology (http://www.fu.uu.se) include the developmental biology research groups of Prof. Rolf Ohlsson and Prof. Reinald Fundele. We provide space in our developmental lab for Dr Graham Budd's group (formally attached to the Department of Earth Sciences), which focuses on invertebrate palaeontology and evolutionary developmental biology.
 
<p>Our research group currently comprises three Swedes and two Canadians; all speak fluent English. The atmosphere of the lab is informal and non-hierarchical. Uppsala is a lively city with some 200,000 inhabitants, a short train journey from the capital Stockholm, and with excellent international travel connections through its proximity to Stockholm International Airport.

<p>A postdoctoral position is available in the lab of Dr. Gage Crump. The broad goal of the lab is to understand, at the molecular and cellular level, how organs acquire precise three-dimensional shapes. To this aim, we study the larval zebrafish head skeleton, where positional information and local epithelial signaling centers interact to shape a small set of unique cartilages. We use a wide range of techniques that include forward genetics, high-resolution time-lapse imaging, and transplantation.
 
<p>Current projects in the lab include the following:
 
<p>1.)  Understanding how positional information translates into skeletal shape by characterizing a set of new mutants with A-P and D-V patterning defects.
 
<p>2.)  Development of the pharyngeal endodermal epithelium and how the endoderm in turn induces local shaping of the head skeleton.
 
<p>3.)  Using developmental knowledge to regenerate cartilages and bones of specific shapes.

</a></font></h2>
<p><center><strong>(University of Pittsburgh, Department of Biological Sciences)</strong></center></p><br>
<p>
An NIH-funded postdoctoral position in the Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Pittsburgh, is available October 1, 2006, to study vascular development using the zebrafish as a model system.  Our laboratory employs a diverse array of molecular, biochemical, imaging, and embryological techniques to elucidate genetic pathways that control vascular development.   Specifically, we are interested in the role of the TGF-beta type I receptor, ALK1, in vascular development and disease.  ALK1 function is critical in vascular development and homeostasis: homozygous ALK1 mutations are embryonic lethal, whereas the heterozygous condition results in the autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia, Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia Type II (HHT2).  Our laboratory is investigating the regulation of expression of ALK1; identifying downstream targets of Alk1 activation; and probing the cellular role of Alk1 within the endothelium.

<p>Our laboratory will be relocating in Fall 2006 to the University of Pittsburgh, where we will be joining a vibrant group of Developmental Biologists in a brand new, state-of-the-art laboratory facility.  We will also be joining an active and growing zebrafish community on the greater University of Pittsburgh campus.  

<p>Qualified candidates must have a PhD in the Biological Sciences and less than 3 years post-doctoral experience; expertise in Molecular Biology; and a strong publication record.  Developmental Biology and/or Cell Biology experience is preferred.  Interested candidates should send (1) a brief cover letter summarizing scientific accomplishments and stating future research goals; (2) a full CV; and (3) full contact information for three references to:</p>

Our group has been investigating mechanisms underlying neuronal development and the role of the secreted frizzled-related proteins (Sfrp) in this process using the zebrafish model. The Sfrps are a family of vertebrate proteins that exert diverse biological effects by virtue of their capacity to modulate Wnt activity. Previously, we showed that Sfrps are expressed in discrete domains in the CNS. Presently, we are searching for a postdoctoral fellow to undertake one of several projects to develop this thematic. These include : i) The study of the role and mechanism of action of Sfrps and their relationship to Wnts in neuronal development using loss- and gain-of-function approaches; ii) The identification and analysis of mutants in neuronal development by mutagenic screening in zebrafish. Screening will be undertaken in T&uuml;bingen in collaboration with the ZF-MODELS consortium and several French laboratories.

<p>The candidate should have a strong background in developmental biology/neurobiology and manipulation of the zebrafish.

<p>Zebrafish (Danio rerio), small tropical fish, have emerged as a prolific, vertebrate model for genetic and developmental studies.  We apply the zebrafish model to investigate cone photoreceptor development and disease.  Cone photoreceptors are critical for sharp, colour vision in daylight and loss of cone photoreceptors leads to severe blindness. Our interests are to identify key regulators that direct cone photoreceptor development and differentiation, and to identify therapeutic targets for cone disease.  Our approaches include genetic screens, transgenesis, fluorescent-activated cell sorting and microarray analysis.</p>

<p><center><strong>(Zebrafish information Network)</strong></center></p><br>
<p>
ZFIN, the zebrafish model organism database, seeks scientific curators to join our dynamic, interactive team of biologists and computer scientists at the University of Oregon in Eugene, OR.

<p>ZFIN curators acquire, analyze and index information about zebrafish gene structures, expression patterns and mutant phenotypes. Successful candidates will be primarily responsible for the curation of zebrafish phenotype data. Particular attention will be given to phenotypes that serve as models of human disease. Zebrafish phenotypes and their human orthologs will be annotated using common terms and methods when possible. Curators also participate in database, web interface and ontology design by providing biological perspectives for new content and display.

<p>A Ph.D. in Life Sciences or M.S. with appropriate experience is required. Applicants should have backgrounds in developmental genetics, comparative genomics or phenotype evaluation, preferably in zebrafish.

<p>More information is available on ZFIN about the <a href="http://zfin.org/cgi-bin/webdriver?MIval=aa-labview.apg&OID=ZDB-LAB-000914-1">staff</a> and the<a href="http://zfin.org/zf_info/dbase/PAPERS/CurrentDataModel/db.html"> database.</a>
