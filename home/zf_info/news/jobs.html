The project aims to establish the molecular mechanisms by which these mutations result in cancer.  
Requirements: An MSc degree and working experience in an internationally accredited research group is necessary.  Knowledge of standard laboratory techniques such as PCR, cloning, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, mammalian cell culture, Northern and Western blotting is required.  Previous experience with zebrafish and with related techniques such as microinjections and photomicroscopy of live embryos is highly desirable.  An understanding of proteomics will be helpful.  Fluency in English is essential.

Cis-regulatory interactions in vertebrate developmental gene expression
Many developmental abnormalities and pathological processes are resulting from the misregulation of gene expression. Such can occur due to mutations and rearrangements of long-range cis-regulatory modules. The target genes involved in disorders caused by mutations in long range elements are difficult to identify, because the mechanisms that provide specificity to long range interaction between enhancers and their cognate promoters are poorly understood. The goal of the project is to identify the cis regulatory properties that determine the specificity of enhancer-promoter interactions during vertebrate embryo development. The methods include transgenesis, reporter gene expression analysis in zebrafish embryos, molecular cloning, embryo phenotype analysis and bioinformatics. This studentship is an ideal opportunity to obtain skills and knowledge in several areas of developmental, molecular and cell biology and bioinformatics. For non-UK residents Toefl exam for English is required. Enquiries can be made by email to FM. The fellowship is for 3 years starting October 2008.

<p>Title: The zebrafish as an in vivo model to understand chemically induced hearing impairment.

<p>Project overview: 
<br>Some compounds have a strong association with hearing (auditory) impairment, i.e. are ototoxic. However, the risk of ototoxicity in new chemical entities is not routinely investigated, mainly because of an absence of convenient methods of assessment. One potentially useful model, is this respect, is the zebrafish, which has previously been used to assess hair cell survival after compound exposure. Despite this, little is known of the precise nature of, or mechanisms leading to, the damage to hair cells in this species. More specifically, it is not known whether the observed ototoxicity parallels that seen in mammals, whether different classes of compound evoke pathological, biochemical and/or genetic responses in analogous auditory-system structures, and how such effects are manifested as alterations in auditory function. 

<p>This project aims to address this knowledge gap by using a range of ototoxins with known mammalian effects to probe equivalent effects in zebrafish. A range of techniques will be used including: detailed histopathological assessment of zebrafish inner ear and lateral line morphology; determination of effects on key pathways associated with ototoxicity in mammals; and functional assessment of auditory performance in zebrafish. The results obtained will be compared with existing models of ototoxicity, for example in vitro mammalian or avian hair cells, to comparatively assess model performance. Overall, this project will help to understand the mechanisms responsible for ototoxicity in zebrafish, and whether these mechanisms and pathological consequences are comparable with those observed in mammalian models of hearing impairment.

<p>A PhD position is available for the DFG funded project "Endocrine timing of
the cell cycle in the zebrafish: The case of glucocorticoids" at the
Institute of Toxicology and Genetics (Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe) in the
group of Thomas Dickmeis.

<p>We study the interplay between endocrinology, metabolism and the circadian
clock in cell cycle regulation, using the zebrafish as our principal model
system. The proposed PhD project involves the generation of biosensors to
measure glucocorticoid signalling activity and cell cycle progression in the
intact animal in order to understand the dynamics of adrenal signals and
their effect on cell cycle progression. These biosensors will enable us to
study the maturation of adrenal signalling and circadian cell cycle dynamics
during development and in mutants with disrupted endocrine functions, and
will constitute valuable tools for genetic and pharmacological screening
approaches.

<p>The Institute of Toxicology and Genetics (ITG) is part of the
Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (FZK, Research Centre Karlsruhe), which is a
member of the "Hermann von Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft Deutscher
Forschungszentren (HGF)". Core research programmes at the ITG are centred on
molecular genetics of cancer, cell differentiation and proliferation,
vertebrate embryology, proteomics, genomics and molecular environmental
toxicology. The institute provides excellent infrastructure for biomedical
research, including mouse, rat, Drosophila and fish facilities, bioimaging
suites, as well as histology, tissue culture and gene array facilities. The
cosmopolitan make-up of the institute is reflected by the fact that staff
members represent 15 different nationalities from around the world and
English is the lingua franca.
