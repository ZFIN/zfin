committed to basic research and its potential medical application. For the
time being, there are five out of about 35 laboratories specifically
working on different aspects of zebrafish development, ranging from early
axis determination, hemopoiesis to liver development. In addition, several
other laboratories also use zebrafish as a model system, for example, to
study immunological systems or produce cDNA microarrays.</p>

The anticipated start date is September 2005, but early employment is possible. This position is funded by the Aquatic Research Consortium (ARC) and the degree would be in the Department of
Coastal Sciences, College of Science and Technology. This is a graduate research assistant position and involves analysis of the effects of exposure to hypoxia and contaminants in small fish species (Japanese medaka and sheepshead minnows). Endpoints being analyzed include early-life stage toxicity and changes in gene expression (toxicogenomics)
in both laboratory exposures and field samples. Our laboratory is equipped with a comparative genomics core (custom microarray production, automatic DNA sequencer, bioanalyzer, real-time PCR), embryo imaging instruments,
and a massive aquatic toxicology facility (12,000 square feet).

<p><center><strong>(Institute of Developmental Genetics - Munich, Germany)</strong></center></p><br>

<p><center><b>Ph.D. Student position<br>
Brain patterning and Neurogenesis in the zebrafish embryo</b></center></p>

<p>A Ph.D. student position is available in the Zebrafish Neurogenetics group of the Technical University, Munich, Germany, to study embryonic brain patterning and neurogenesis in vertebrates. </p>

<p>Our main model system is the embryo of the zebrafish, <em>Danio rerio</em>. We primarily focus on the midbrain-hindbrain territory, where neurogenesis control permits the long-lasting maintenance of undifferentiated cells at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB). These cells are important for midbrain-hindbrain growth and diversification throughout life, and can serve as a model for the study of vertebrate neuronal progenitors. </p>

<p>We recently identified two crucial factors involved in the formation and maintenance of these progenitors (Geling et al., Development, 2003; Geling et al., Development, 2004; Ninkovic et al., Development, in press) and we now aim at analyzing the molecular and cellular cascades involving these factors. Projects will include isolating and testing the function of new genes expressed within the presumptive midbrain-hindbrain progenitor pool, studying midbrain-hindbrain regulatory elements in transgenic lines, and analysing the integration of patterning signals and neurogenesis control at the MHB. We routinely use non-genetic techniques such as RNA / DNA injections into zebrafish embryos, lineage tracing and transplantations, and have expertise with genetic approaches including transgenesis, mutagenesis and molecular mapping.</p>

<p>The group is located at the GSF-Research Centre in Munich / Neuherberg, with a high-performance zebrafish facility and core facilities for high throughput molecular techniques. The GSF-Research Centre hosts several strong development biology groups focussing on brain or skeletal development in the mouse, chicken or zebrafish.</p>

<p>The applicants should have a strong interest in developmental biology and / or neurogenesis. Previous experience with the zebrafish system is not required. Applicants should send a curriculum vitae by post or e-mail to the address below. Whenever possible, two reference letters should be provided.</p>

<p>The applicant should not have pet fish at home.</p>

<p>At the Medical Faculty, University of Troms&oslash;, there is a  post doc position open for 3 years in the field of molecular genetics/developmental biology. The position is a part of a collaboration between research groups at the Institute of Pharmacy and the Institute of Medical Biology, and it plays a central part in the establishment of  zebrafish as a model system. The project is a part of the research strategy of the Medical Faculty.</p>

<p>The involved research groups study the transcription factor Pax6 and the nuclear protein SPBP, in addition to the atypical protein kinase C isoforms lambda and zeta and their interaction partners. These are all important factors for transcriptional regulation and cell signalling, maybe best illustrated by their association with cancer and other diseases. To gain further information of the biological function of the gene products we study, their target genes and interaction partners, zebrafish will be used as a model-system. Knowledge about zebrafish/fish development (embryology, anatomy and physiology) and/or molecular genetic techniques such as immunohistochemistry and RNA in situ hybridisation is required.</p>

<p>To be considered for the position the candidate needs to have a PhD.</p>

<p><center><strong>(Harvard Medical School)</strong></center></p><br>

<p>A position is available to study the biology of the TRP ion channel
polycystin2 in zebrafish. The immediate goals of this project are to
characterize the phenotype of polycystin2 loss of function in various organs
in the developing zebrafish with a primary focus on the pronephric kidney.
This position will involve microinjection of antisense oligos, and
determination of outcomes using standard histology, in situ hybridization,
and analysis of electron micrographs. This study can also involve developing
new optical technology for physiological readouts of calcium ion activity in
living embryos. Other projects relating to the development and function of
the zebrafish pronephros may also be pursued depending on the interests and
motivation of the fellow.</p>

<p><center><strong>(New Cardiovascular Research Institute - Rochester, NY)</strong></center></p><br>

<p>As part of its $500 million 10-year initiative, the University of Rochester School of Medicine has purchased an 88,000 square foot research building which will become home to a new Cardiovascular Research Institute. The Institute will build upon a well-established research base in vascular biology, ischemia-reperfusion injury, molecular pharmacology, signal transduction and cardiovasculomics (see <a href="http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/Aab/Cardio.htm">www.urmc.rochester.edu/Aab/Cardio.htm</a>). Competitive start-up packages are presently available for two tenure-track faculty positions. We are particularly interested in those candidates with demonstrable promise in the area of zebrafish cardiovascular development. Qualified applicants should send a curriculum vitae, research plan, and three letters of recommendation to:</p>
