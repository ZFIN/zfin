<center><strong>(Section on Vertebrate Development, NICHD)</strong></center><br>

<p>
The Section on Vertebrate Development, NICHD, is recruiting a postdoctoral fellow to begin in Fall 2010. We are interested in working out novel aspects of signal transduction and gene regulation in early vertebrate development. Our focus is on the neural crest and the mesoderm of Xenopus and zebrafish embryos. Our entry point into these problems was the discovery of Inka, a novel gene that is required for both craniofacial development and mesoderm/notochord morphogenesis. Inka functions as a cytoskeletal regulator and also as an effector of cell-cell signals such as FGF. It interacts with and regulates the activity of PAK4, a protein kinase that transduces important developmental signals in vertebrates that regulate cytoskeletal dynamics, cell adhesion, migration and other processes in development and cancer progression.
<p>
We use embryology, molecular and cell biology, and genomic technology to identify components of regulatory pathways and their functions in the embryo. Online applications are accepted, or you may contact the PI at <a href="mailto:tsargent@nih.gov">tsargent@nih.gov</a>.

<h2 align="center"><font color="#004080" size="5"><a name="qmul">Postdoctoral Research Assistant, Ref: 10334/CA</a></font></h2>

<center><strong>(University of London)</strong></center><br>

<p>
We are seeking a highly motivated Postdoctoral Research Assistant to join Dr Caroline Brennan on a project entitled 'Developing behavioural assays in zebrafish to identify genetic mechanisms underlying drug seeking and vulnerability to drug abuse'.
<p>
Drug abuse is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the UK and US. Relapse, the return to drug taking following extended periods of abstinence, is a characteristic of addiction and remains a major problem for its treatment (Stewart, J. Review, Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci, 2008. 363(1507): p. 3147-58).  While much is known of the pathophysiology associated with drug abuse, relatively little is known of developmental and molecular mechanisms that underlie differences in individual propensity for drug seeking and the likelihood of relapse. Here we aim to develop behavioural assays of drug seeking in zebrafish and use these to identify developmental and genetic mechanisms contributing to propensity for compulsive drug seeking and return to drug taking following abstinence, critical aspects of drug addiction. 
<p>
This is a full-time, fixed term post available for 3 years.  The starting salary will be &#163;33,659 per annum.  The post is funded by the Medical Research Council's National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (<a href="http://nc3rs.tnllive.co.uk">http://nc3rs.tnllive.co.uk</a>).  The salary is inclusive of London allowance. Benefits include 30 days annual leave, final salary pension scheme and an interest-free season ticket loan.
<p>
The successful applicant will have experience of behavioural analysis in rodent or other model species.  Knowledge of reward pathways or of zebrafish as a model system is desirable but not essential. 
<p>
Candidates must be able to demonstrate their eligibility to work in the UK in accordance with the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006. Where required this may include entry clearance or continued leave to remain under the Points Based Immigration Scheme.
<p>
Informal enquiries should be addressed to Dr Caroline Brennan (<a href="mailto:c.h.brennan@qmul.ac.uk">c.h.brennan@qmul.ac.uk</a> tel: 020 7882 3011).

<center><strong>(University of Michigan)</strong></center><br>

<p>
The Kuwada lab seeks a postdoc to analyze the function of a gene that is required for formation of the nerve/muscle synapse in zebrafish. We have identified a zebrafish mutation in a gene that regulates the development of the neuromuscular junction. The gene encodes a muscle receptor for a signaling molecule secreted by the terminals of motor neurons that is necessary for the accumulation of neurotransmitter receptors at the neuromuscular junction. The project includes the generation of transgenic zebrafish in which various mutated versions of this gene are expressed by mutant muscles in order to assay how different domains of the receptor contribute to synapse formation. Experience with molecular biology, immunocytochemistry and biochemistry are highly desired for this project. The position is available now and is funded by a NIH grant.

The University of Sheffield has a long-standing tradition and world-wide reputation for top-level molecular biological research. The Department of Neuroscience is based in the University of Sheffield School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences and collaborates with the MRC Centre for Developmental and Biomedical Genetics.  A new state of the art research facility, which includes a drug screening laboratory at the Sheffield Institute for Translational Neurosciences (SITraN) is scheduled for completion in summer 2010.  The MRC Centre for Developmental and Biomedical Genetics (refurbished 2006) is fully equipped for work with zebrafish, and has recently expanded its capacity to over 23,000 litres capable of holding approximately 80,000 fish. Thus it is one of the largest zebrafish research facilities in the Europe.  The UK Universities Research Assessment Exercise (RAE-2007) panel ranked the Neurology unit headed by Prof. Shaw as among the top-8 in UK. The MRC Centre with whom we have an ongoing collaboration is a leader in utilizing zebrafish in biomedical research. The overall goal of both centres is to translate basic science into new therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. 

<p>The laboratory of Dr. Tennore Ramesh and Prof. Pamela Shaw at the Department of Neurosciences are currently offering a PhD studentship that will provide generous stipend for 3 years.  The student will get an opportunity to conduct research in the new state of the art research facility at SiTraN and work on developing and utilizing zebrafish models of MND in target and drug discovery.

<center><strong>(Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee WI)</strong></center><br>

<p>
Multiple post-doctoral positions are open in the Developmental Vascular Biology program in the Ramchandran Lab at the Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee WI. The Developmental Vascular Biology program investigates the basic mechanisms of blood vessel formation in vertebrates and the contribution of the vasculature to disease states. We study how a specified endothelial precursor cell (angioblast) eventually differentiates into artery or vein. The basic mechanisms of this process often are dysregulated in disease. Therefore, understanding the basic mechanisms of vessel formation will generate new treatments for conditions affected by deregulated vessel growth.

<p>For additional information, please visit the web site <a href="http://www.chw.org/vascularbiology">http://www.chw.org/vascularbiology</a>

<p>Applicants interested in studying vasculogenesis, angiogenesis or small molecule chemical biology approaches in zebrafish are welcome. Applicants are expected to be highly motivated, and willing to think out of the box. Experience in zebrafish or other developmental model systems preferred but not necessary. Excellent Molecular Biology skills are desirable. A strong sense of team environment and yearning knowledge is key as well. To apply for this position, please send an email with a recent CV, and names of three references to <a href="mailto:rramchan@mcw.edu">rramchan@mcw.edu</a>.
