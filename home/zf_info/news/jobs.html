<HR>

  

<p>Highly motivated individuals are invited to apply
for a graduate student appointment in the Division of Matrix Biology (MBB) at
the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden. Our research group is interested in
the developmental signals that control growth and differentiation during
vertebrate kidney organogenesis. Because the nephron is the functional unit of
the kidney and the pathophysiological site of human kidney diseases, including
glomerular pathologies, we have concentrated our research efforts on identifying
the molecular/genetic regulation of nephron formation. Topics of investigation
include nephron segmentation, tubulogenesis, and glomerular morphogenesis.</p>
<p>Our lab is using the zebrafish embryonic kidney
or pronephros as a model system for investigating kidney organogenesis due to
several experimental advantages including anatomical simplicity, rapid
development, and the ease plus detail of visualization using molecular probes.
The zebrafish pronephros system is amenable to genetic analysis, and mutants
have been informative for identifying important genes and cellular interactions
during pronephric organogenesis (<i>Development</i>, <b>125</b>, pp. 4655-67,
1998; <i>Dev Gen</i>., <b>24</b>, pp. 220-29, 1999; <i>Dev. Biol</i>. <b>222</b>,
pp. 147-57, 2000). The zebrafish mutant no isthmus (noi) contains a mutation in
the transcription factor Pax2.1 and is associated with pleiotrophic defects
including those affecting pronephric development. During pronephric
organogenesis, pronephric tubules do not form in noi mutants due to problems in
patterning of the nephric primordium (Development, 127, pp. 2089-98, 2000). We
are using the noi mutant as an entrance point into investigating the genetic
pathways that cooperate with Pax2.1 to regulate nephron segmentation and renal
tubular differentiation. In related projects, we are using the zebrafish
pronephric system to study the gene function in glomerular maturation and
function. Experimental approaches involve genetic screens, antisense morpholino
technology, microarrays, and transgenesis.</p>
<p>Research will be conducted in the new Karolinska
Institutet Zebrafish Facility and the Division of Matrix Biology, both located
in the Scheelelaboratoriet on the Karolinska Institutet (Solna) campus. Located
close to the Stockholm city center, the Karolinska Institutet is one of Europe's
largest medical universities and has strong and dynamic graduate student
research programs in the basic and clinical sciences.</p>
<p>Research will be conducted in pursuit of a
doctoral degree in Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology. KI provides an
international environment encouraging collaboration and scientific interaction.
Interested applicants should have an interest in kidney organogenesis and prior
research experience. Please send complete applications including cover letter,
CV, and contact information for three references to:</p>

Available July 1, 2004. 
<P>
Study organogenesis of the intestine utilizing the
zebrafish for classical genetic analysis. Projects
will consist of positional cloning of genes essential
for the morphogenesis of intestinal villi, followed by
molecular and embryological analysis to dissect
developmental pathways.  The primary mission of the
lab is to address basic questions in organ development
with potential applications to treating digestive
organ failure in children.  The lab is in the
Department of Pediatrics (Gastroenterology Division)
and is closely affiliated with the Department of Cell
Biology and the Human Molecular Genetics Center, with
many opportunities for academic interaction.  We have
a new 3000-tank AHAB fish facility adjacent to the
laboratory, genomic and informatics infrastructure,
and unique mutants with mapped loci ready for cloning.
