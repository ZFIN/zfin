This post is funded through a three year MRC grant, and forms part of a larger group headed by Greg Elgar, which aims to identify and functionally characterise highly conserved non-coding sequences in vertebrate genomes.  The post holder will use manipulation and analysis of zebrafish embryos to study the effects that these sequences have on the expression of key developmental regulators during early development.  The successful applicant will join a multidisciplinary laboratory that results from the close integration of wet and dry lab approaches, bringing together expertise in functional genomics and bioinformatics.  Applicants should possess a PhD (or equivalent experience) in the area of zebrafish development and have a working knowledge of transgenic techniques and embryo anatomy.

<p>Starting salary will depend on previous experience and will include London Allowance.

<p>The Board of Electors to the Professorship of Physiology invite applications for this Professorship from persons whose work falls within the field of Cellular Physiology.

<p>On 1 January 2006 the Departments of Anatomy and Physiology merged to form a new Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience consolidating research and teaching strengths, and creating dynamic synergies within and across themed research groups. Substantial refurbishment of the Department's research and teaching spaces is well advanced and the University has agreed to fund several new posts. A key aspiration of the new Department is to build world-class research groups at the cutting edge of the science that links genes, cells and tissues in the study of physiology, development and neuroscience. As part of this exciting initiative, two Professorships are available for appointment as soon as possible for established outstanding scientists to lead research teams in the fields of Integrative Biology and Cellular Physiology.

<p><center><strong>(Danio Labs Ltd. - Cambridge UK)</strong></center></p><br>
<p>DanioLabs is a Cambridge (UK) based therapeutics company that uses phenotype driven drug discovery technologies to identify novel treatments for a variety of human diseases. A major part of the DanioLabs' platform involves the use of zebrafish as an experimental species. Using these models, the Company is able to identify activity of experimental compounds, and to provide the additional evidence relevant to the treatment of the disease needed to progress such compounds cost-effectively through the drug development process.</p>
<p>As a result of recent successes, DanioLabs is expanding its operations and is looking to recruit an outstanding post-doctoral researcher to join our program in the identification of therapeutics for multiple sclerosis.  DanioLabs strategy focuses on identifying molecules which promote remyelination of the nervous system and utilises proprietary high throughput in vivo models in larval zebrafish, coupled with systematic, compound screens.  The zebrafish work integrates into a wider program of therapy identification in multiple sclerosis encompassing inter-linked basic science and clinical work in the Cambridge area.</p>
<p>The successful individual will have exceptional scientific acumen as well as leadership skills.  He/she should have either a proven track record in developmental biology or experience in the field of oligodendrocyte biology.  Experience in working with zebrafish would be an advantage but is not essential.  The position will provide unique training exposure, exceptional publication opportunities and future career enhancement and flexibility, in a dynamic and friendly commercial environment.</p>
<p>Applicants should send their CV, full publication list and details of 2 referees to <a href="mailto:recruitment@daniolabs.com">recruitment@daniolabs.com</a>. Closing date 2nd December 2005.</p>
