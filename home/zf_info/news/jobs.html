<p>Postdoctoral Researcher m/f
<p>full time (38 hours/week)

<p>to work on:

<p>Modeling Alzheimer's disease in zebrafish: "Fishing expedition" for modifiers of phenotypes caused by Familial Alzheimer's disease mutations in Presenilin 1

<p>Description of the project: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder and the most prevalent cause of dementia for which there is currently no treatment..  Inherited, Familial AD (FAD) is caused predominantly by mutations in presenilin (PS) genes. To model AD in vivo we are generating transgenic fish carrying human FAD-PS1 mutations. Zebrafish is unique among vertebrates in its amenability to genetic and chemical screens. We will exploit this advantage in order to discover genes and chemicals that can modify (suppress or enhance) aberrant phenotypes that derive from malfunctions of mutated Presenilin-1 that causes FAD. The primary goals are to study the biology of FAD-PS1 expressing cells at the single cell level and to discover molecular entry points into pathway(s) that mediate FAD-PS1 phenotypes To this end we will perform genetic and chemical screens on zebrafish embryos that are transgenic for human FAD-PS1 mutations. Employing transgenic zebrafish carrying human FAD-PS1 mutations we will: (1) Determine phenotype of fluorescently tagged  FAD-PS1 expressing neurons in tgFAD-fish in vivo. (2)  Define in tgFAD-PS1 embryos a phenotypic read-out for use in genetic and chemical screens in tgFAD-PS1 embryos. (3) Carry out a dominant forward screen and an initial chemical screen on selected read-outs. The research entails concepts and techniques from genetics, neurobiology, embryology, cell biology and molecular biology

<p>Requirements: The candidate should have affinity with working on Alzheimer's disease. The self-motivated candidate should have a solid track record and proven capacity to independently and creatively carry out research.  He or she preferably has experience with molecular techniques and confocal microscopy.

<p>Duration: In principle the project is granted for two years but continuation into the second year is based on the satisfactory progress within the first year.

<p>Salary: According to "CAO-Nederlandse universiteiten" (CAO-NU): salary scale 10-11, depending on age and experience, excluding 8% holiday allowance and a year-end bonus.

<p>Location: Utrecht, The Netherlands.

Cis-regulatory interactions in vertebrate developmental gene expression
Many developmental abnormalities and pathological processes are resulting from the misregulation of gene expression. Such can occur due to mutations and rearrangements of long-range cis-regulatory modules. The target genes involved in disorders caused by mutations in long range elements are difficult to identify, because the mechanisms that provide specificity to long range interaction between enhancers and their cognate promoters are poorly understood. The goal of the project is to identify the cis regulatory properties that determine the specificity of enhancer-promoter interactions during vertebrate embryo development. The methods include transgenesis, reporter gene expression analysis in zebrafish embryos, molecular cloning, embryo phenotype analysis and bioinformatics. This studentship is an ideal opportunity to obtain skills and knowledge in several areas of developmental, molecular and cell biology and bioinformatics. For non-UK residents Toefl exam for English is required. Enquiries can be made by email to FM. The fellowship is for 3 years starting October 2008.

<p>The German research network (SFB 596) 'Molecular Mechanisms of Neurodegeneration' in Munich offers two PhD positions for highly motivated candidates with previous exposure to the zebrafish model. The two positions will form the core of a collaborative study between the two major Munich universities, which aims at using in vivo imaging to study genetic models of neurodegeneration in zebrafish. One position (at LMU) will focus on the molecular analysis of transgenic fish models of Alzheimer's disease and tauopathies, which have been already established. Technically, this project will involve in-depth histological and biochemical analysis and include development of drug screening procedures and translational aspects of research. The second position (at TUM) will emphasize in vivo imaging analysis of neurodegenerative phenotypes in fish using molecular imaging techniques, confocal and two-photon analysis. Thetwo projects will be highly interdigitated and co-supervised, thus a successful PhD-candidate will be exposed to a wide variety of techniques ranging from fish husbandry to cutting-edge imaging and drug development. Payment will be according to German tariff law (TvOeD); integration in one of the neurobiology graduate schools in Munich is possible.

<p>Title: The zebrafish as an in vivo model to understand chemically induced hearing impairment.

<p>Project overview: 
<br>Some compounds have a strong association with hearing (auditory) impairment, i.e. are ototoxic. However, the risk of ototoxicity in new chemical entities is not routinely investigated, mainly because of an absence of convenient methods of assessment. One potentially useful model, is this respect, is the zebrafish, which has previously been used to assess hair cell survival after compound exposure. Despite this, little is known of the precise nature of, or mechanisms leading to, the damage to hair cells in this species. More specifically, it is not known whether the observed ototoxicity parallels that seen in mammals, whether different classes of compound evoke pathological, biochemical and/or genetic responses in analogous auditory-system structures, and how such effects are manifested as alterations in auditory function. 

<p>This project aims to address this knowledge gap by using a range of ototoxins with known mammalian effects to probe equivalent effects in zebrafish. A range of techniques will be used including: detailed histopathological assessment of zebrafish inner ear and lateral line morphology; determination of effects on key pathways associated with ototoxicity in mammals; and functional assessment of auditory performance in zebrafish. The results obtained will be compared with existing models of ototoxicity, for example in vitro mammalian or avian hair cells, to comparatively assess model performance. Overall, this project will help to understand the mechanisms responsible for ototoxicity in zebrafish, and whether these mechanisms and pathological consequences are comparable with those observed in mammalian models of hearing impairment.

<center><strong>(Centre For Prions &amp; Protein Folding Diseases, University of Alberta, CANADA)</strong></center><br>


<p>Zebrafish Models of Prion Disease

<p>Fully funded post-doctoral and graduate student positions are available immediately in the newly renovated CENTRE for PRIONS &amp; PROTEIN FOLDING DISEASES at the University of Alberta. An innovative research program is underway addressing hypotheses of prion protein function and dysfunction in neurodevelopment. This research will be led by Dr. Ted Allison in close collaboration with Dr. David Westaway.

<p>The CENTRE for PRIONS &amp; PROTEIN FOLDING DISEASES will house several principal investigators and provide exceptional infrastructure, including molecular biology and microscopy/imaging services, and dedicated wet-lab and containment lab areas for their research activities.  Many possibilities exist for collaborations with scientists within the Centre for Neurosciences, the National Institute for Nanotechnology, and the Network Centres of Excellence (NCE: "PrioNet").  Funding potential for prion research in Canada is amongst the best in the world with Federal (NCE) and provincial (Alberta Prion Research Institute, "APRI") initiatives yielding an annual budget of $10m for the next five years. Alberta-based researchers are also well positioned for both national and provincial biomedical research funding.

<p>Our methodologies will focus on the use of mutant and transgenic zebrafish, histology, molecular biology and biochemistry. Longer-term potential exists to analyze phenotypes using electrophysiology and testing hypotheses we develop in transgenic mice. Experience in molecular biology, histology, fluorescent microscopy, electrophysiology, neurodegenerative diseases, or zebrafish are desirable. A demonstrable record of leadership ability would also be an asset.
