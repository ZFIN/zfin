<p>We are seeking two postdoctoral fellows to join
our laboratory starting January 2004. We are a new group in the Program in
Vascular Biology headed by Dr. Judah Folkman, at the Children's Hospital,
Harvard Medical School. We use genetic, chemical genetic and molecular
approaches to dissect signaling pathways in the zebrafish, with the goal of
understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying angiogenesis in an intact
vertebrate organism. An example of our work is found in Chan et al., 2002,
&quot;Dissection of angiogenic signaling using a chemical genetic
approach&quot;, <i>Cancer Cell</i>, <b>1</b>: 257-267. We have recently isolated
a series of new angiogenic mutants from a novel genetic screen in heterozygous
zebrafish embryos using a small molecule kinase inhibitor. These mutants display
vascular phenotypes as homozygous recessives. Projects include characterization
and positional cloning of these angiogenic mutants as well as development of
transgenic lines. Ideal for new graduates interested in using the zebrafish for
cancer-relevant signal transduction studies. Salary will be at NIH levels.</p>

biology or genetics. Zebrafish experience is preferred but training will also be

<p>Highly motivated individuals are invited to apply
for a post-doctoral scientist appointment in the Division of Matrix Biology (MBB)
at the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden. Our research group is interested
in the developmental signals that control growth and differentiation during
vertebrate kidney organogenesis. Because the nephron is the functional unit of
the kidney and the pathophysiological site of human kidney diseases, including
glomerular pathologies, we have concentrated our research efforts on identifying
the molecular/genetic regulation of nephron formation. Topics of investigation
include nephron segmentation, tubulogenesis, and glomerular morphogenesis. Our
lab is using the zebrafish embryonic kidney or pronephros as a model system for
investigating kidney organogenesis due to several experimental advantages
including anatomical simplicity, rapid development, and the ease plus detail of
visualization using molecular probes. The zebrafish pronephros system is
amenable to genetic analysis, and mutants have been informative for identifying
important genes and cellular interactions during pronephric organogenesis
(Development, 125, pp. 4655-67, 1998; Dev Gen., 24, pp. 220-29, 1999; Dev. Biol.
222, pp. 147-57, 2000). The zebrafish mutant <i>no isthmus</i> (<i>noi</i>)
contains a mutation in the transcription factor Pax2.1 and is associated with
pleiotrophic defects including those affecting pronephric development. During
pronephric organogenesis, pronephric tubules do not form in noi mutants due to
problems in patterning of the nephric primordium (Development, 127, pp. 2089-98,
2000). We are using the <i>noi </i>mutant as an entrance point into
investigating the genetic pathways that cooperate with Pax2.1 to regulate
nephron segmentation and renal tubular differentiation. In related projects, we
are using the zebrafish pronephric system to study the gene function in
glomerular maturation and function. Experimental approaches involve genetic
screens, antisense morpholino technology, microarrays, and transgenesis.
Research will be conducted in the new Karolinska Institutet Zebrafish Facility
and the Division of Matrix Biology, both located in the Scheelelaboratoriet on
the Karolinska Institutet (Solna) campus. Located close to the Stockholm city
center, the Karolinska Institutet is one of Europes largest medical
universities and has strong and dynamic research programs in th e basic and
clinical sciences. KI provides an international environment encouraging
collaboration and scientific interaction. Interested applicants should have an
interest in kidney organogenesis and prior research experience in molecular and
developmental biology.&nbsp;</p>

<HR>

  

<p>Highly motivated individuals are invited to apply
for a graduate student appointment in the Division of Matrix Biology (MBB) at
the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden. Our research group is interested in
the developmental signals that control growth and differentiation during
vertebrate kidney organogenesis. Because the nephron is the functional unit of
the kidney and the pathophysiological site of human kidney diseases, including
glomerular pathologies, we have concentrated our research efforts on identifying
the molecular/genetic regulation of nephron formation. Topics of investigation
include nephron segmentation, tubulogenesis, and glomerular morphogenesis.</p>
<p>Our lab is using the zebrafish embryonic kidney
or pronephros as a model system for investigating kidney organogenesis due to
several experimental advantages including anatomical simplicity, rapid
development, and the ease plus detail of visualization using molecular probes.
The zebrafish pronephros system is amenable to genetic analysis, and mutants
have been informative for identifying important genes and cellular interactions
during pronephric organogenesis (<i>Development</i>, <b>125</b>, pp. 4655-67,
1998; <i>Dev Gen</i>., <b>24</b>, pp. 220-29, 1999; <i>Dev. Biol</i>. <b>222</b>,
pp. 147-57, 2000). The zebrafish mutant no isthmus (noi) contains a mutation in
the transcription factor Pax2.1 and is associated with pleiotrophic defects
including those affecting pronephric development. During pronephric
organogenesis, pronephric tubules do not form in noi mutants due to problems in
patterning of the nephric primordium (Development, 127, pp. 2089-98, 2000). We
are using the noi mutant as an entrance point into investigating the genetic
pathways that cooperate with Pax2.1 to regulate nephron segmentation and renal
tubular differentiation. In related projects, we are using the zebrafish
pronephric system to study the gene function in glomerular maturation and
function. Experimental approaches involve genetic screens, antisense morpholino
technology, microarrays, and transgenesis.</p>
<p>Research will be conducted in the new Karolinska
Institutet Zebrafish Facility and the Division of Matrix Biology, both located
in the Scheelelaboratoriet on the Karolinska Institutet (Solna) campus. Located
close to the Stockholm city center, the Karolinska Institutet is one of Europe's
largest medical universities and has strong and dynamic graduate student
research programs in the basic and clinical sciences.</p>
<p>Research will be conducted in pursuit of a
doctoral degree in Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology. KI provides an
international environment encouraging collaboration and scientific interaction.
Interested applicants should have an interest in kidney organogenesis and prior
research experience. Please send complete applications including cover letter,
CV, and contact information for three references to:</p>

<h2><font color="#004080" size="5"><a name="williams">Essel Postdoctoral Fellow in Neuroscience</a></font></h2>
<p>(Williams College - Williamstown, MA)</p>

<p><center><A href="#Jobs">Back to top</A></center></p>

<HR>

<p>For the past twelve years, the Neuroscience Program at Williams College has been the recipient of an Essel Foundation grant to encourage talented undergraduate students to pursue careers in neuroscience. An integral part of the grant is the Essel Postdoctoral Research Fellowship. The Essel Fellow has responsibility for teaching the laboratory portion of our Introduction to Neuroscience course each fall. The remainder of the Fellow's time is reserved for their own research under the mentorship of one of the six neuroscientists at Williams College (http://www.williams.edu/Neuroscience/faculty.shtml. Also see http://www.williams.edu/biology/lhutson). Research funds are available.

The position is ideally suited for a neuroscientist who would like more teaching experience. In the past, Fellows have all gone on from this position to tenure-track positions. Candidates must have a recent Ph.D. in neuroscience or a related field. This is a full-time, one-year term position beginning on July 01, 2004 and renewable for up to four additional years. The review of resumes will begin on February 27, 2004, and continue until the position is filled.
Please send cover letter and resume including Job # 300050-W to:

<blockquote>
Office of Human Resources<br>
