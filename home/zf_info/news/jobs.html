<p>
A postdoctoral position is available in the laboratory of Prof. Pascale Zimmermann to study a novel signaling pathway in zebrafish.

<p>We are looking for an interactive, enthusiastic and driven scientist for a research project at the junction of cell, developmental and cancer biology.

<p>Funding is initially for 2 years in the Laboratory for Signal Integration in Cell Fate Decision ( <a href="http://med.kuleuven.be/cme-mg/LabIntro/PascaleZimmermann_en.html">http://med.kuleuven.be/cme-mg/LabIntro/PascaleZimmermann_en.html</a> ) at the Center of Human Genetics at the University of Leuven/Department of Molecular and Developmental Genetics. The department is composed of very diverse and international labs.

<p>The project aims at clarifying the role of syntenin in the control of morphogen gradients during early embryogenesis in zebrafish. Syntenin is a molecular scaffold, linking heparan sulfate proteoglycans and their associated growth factors and adhesion molecules to the machineries of vesicular trafficking (recycling and exosomes) and to growth factor receptors. Previous experience with zebrafish is required.

Postdoctoral position to study retinal development
at the University of Pittsburgh
 
 
<p>A postdoctoral position is available to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms of cellular pattern formation in the zebrafish retina. The vertebrate retina develops from a single sheet of polarized neuroepithelial cells, which later differentiate and reorganize into a multilayered structure. Each retinal layer is composed of specific cell classes and executes distinct functions. It is largely unknown how this dramatic and intriguing organogenesis process is accomplished during early development.

<center><strong>(University of Pittsburgh )</strong></center><br>


<p>
An NIH-funded postdoctoral position in the Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Pittsburgh, is available immediately to study vascular development using the zebrafish as a model system.  Our laboratory employs a diverse array of molecular, biochemical, imaging, and embryological techniques to elucidate genetic pathways that control vascular development.   Specifically, we are interested in the role of the TGF-beta type I receptor, ALK1, in vascular development and disease.  ALK1 function is critical in vascular development and homeostasis: homozygous ALK1 mutations are embryonic lethal, whereas the heterozygous condition results in the autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia, Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia Type 2 (HHT2).  Our laboratory is interested in investigating the regulation of alk1 expression; identifying downstream targets of Alk1 activation; and probing the cellular role of Alk1 within the endothelium.

<p>Our department is home to an interactive group of Developmental Biologists studying a variety of developmental processes in zebrafish, Drosophila, mouse, and C. elegans. Our laboratory is also part of an active and growing zebrafish community on the University of Pittsburgh campus, as well as the campus-wide Center for Vascular Remodeling and Regeneration.
 
<p>Qualified candidates must have a PhD and less than 3 years post-doctoral experience,  and a strong publication record.  Developmental Biology and/or molecular biology experience required; expertise in mechanotransduction preferred.  Interested candidates should send (1) a brief cover letter summarizing scientific accomplishments and stating future research goals; (2) a full CV; and (3) full contact information for three references to:

<center><strong>(Tufts University Medical School, Boston, MA)</strong></center><br>


<p>
Postdoctoral positions are available at Tufts University Medical School, Boston, to study human craniofacial and tooth development and regeneration using the zebrafish model. The focus of the laboratory is to elucidate molecular mechanisms regulating normal and abnormal craniofacial and tooth development and regeneration, for the eventual development of clinically relevant repair therapies in humans.  Ongoing zebrafish projects include an ongoing large-scale mutagenesis screen for novel mineralized tissue mutants, and characterizations of already identified craniofacial and replacement tooth mutants.  A large, newly renovated, laboratory in the Tufts Medical School contains state of the art microscopy, microinjection, and histological analysis capabilities, and a new 2,000 tank zebrafish facility.  Extensive core facilities are available in the Tufts Medical and Sackler Graduate Schools.  Successful candidates must have or be close to obtaining a Ph.D. degree, and a strong background in molecular biology and/or genetics. A knowledge of genetic, molecular, microarray and proteomics technologies, and zebrafish husbandry are desirable. The successful applicant must be able to work well with others, and independently and productively, and exhibit proficiency in writing articles for peer-reviewed journals, and grants.  

<p>Please submit current curriculum vitae, a statement of research experience, and complete contact information for three references to:

SCIENTIFIC TECHNICIAN POSITION AT FOX CHASE CANCER CENTER, 333 Cottman Avenue, Philadelphia, PA   19111
<br>Requisition #09-0035
<br>ZEBRA FISH FACILITY
<br>FULL TIME (MAY INCLUDE WEEKENDS)

<p>
We are looking for a core animal facility technician to facilitate zebrafish research in multiple laboratories. The primary responsibilities will be to facilitate zebrafish research for multiple laboratories, and care and maintenance of the core zebrafish facility as necessary. Duties will be to act as a liaison for labs undertaking zebrafish projects and design and perform experiments as requested.  Experiments will likely include morpholino knockdown, genetic screening, engineering transgenic animals, and the development of assays and analytical tools.

<p>
B.S. degree in biology or a related field is preferred, but may be substituted by relevant work experience.  Candidates with prior experience rearing zebrafish and performing microinjection, whole mount RNA in situ hybridization, cryosectioning, PCR and DNA cloning are preferred. Candidates should have experience in molecular biology techniques, a background in zebrafish embryology, and the ability to work independently. Applicants are expected have a high level of organizational and communication skills.  Local applicants are preferred as interview transportation and relocation is not the responsibility of Fox Chase Cancer Center.

<p>
A postdoctoral position is available immediately in the laboratory of Dr.
Matthias Hammerschmidt at the Institute for Developmental Biology, University
of Cologne, Germany. The project is part of the Cologne Excellence Cluster on
Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), and deals with
the formation and function of the hypothalamic-hypophyseal axis, with
particular focus on the neuroendocrine control of feeding behavior, energy
homeostasis, obesity and somatic growth, using the zebrafish as a model
organism.

<p>Studies include the generation of transgenic lines for in vivo imaging of the
plasticity within the hypothalamic melanocortin system in wild-type and mutant
fish under different physiological conditions, as well as mutant screens after
chemical and insertional mutagenesis.

<p>Applications are invited from candidates who have a background in developmental,
cellular and/or molecular biology, or in endocrinology. Please send your
application, together with your CV and a list of referees, preferably via
email, to:
