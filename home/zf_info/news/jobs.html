<p>Postdoctoral and Ph.D. positions are available at the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg, Germany to join our work on investigating development and function of neuronal circuits within the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus, a key integrative center in the brain, controls immense number of crucial bodily functions such as sleep, reproduction, food intake, and stress response yet relatively little is known about its development.  We combine forward genetics screen, extensive confocal live imaging and biochemical methods to analyze 1) basic paradigms of hypothalamic neuronal specification, and 2) connectivity and functional properties of select hypothalamic circuits. We are particularly interested in the circuitry underlying stress response whose hyperactivation is implicated in depression.

<p>Interested postdoc candidate must have a Ph.D. in biological sciences, deep interest in neuroscience and excellent background in neuroanatomy. Expertise in live imaging using confocal microscopy is strongly preferred and solid molecular biology experience is desirable. Interested Ph.D candidate must have a deep interest in developmental neurobiology and a genuine interest in pursuing research science as a career. Practical experiences in neurobiology and/or developmental biology are desirable. Prior experience with zebrafish is not mandatory.

<p>This will be a terrific opportunity for the candidate to build a career in an area of great biomedical relevance using a model organism ideally suited for neuronal circuit analysis due to its transparency and tractability. Max Planck Institute for Medical Research provides a stimulating interdisciplinary environment and a state-of-art infrastructure for imaging.  Start date is flexible but preferably around July 1, 2008.

TWO POST-DOCTORAL POSITIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO STUDY SYNAPTIC FUNCTION IN THE VISUAL SYSTEM OF ZEBRAFISH

<p>1.  SYNAPTIC PROCESSING OF VISUAL INFORMATION IN VIVO INVESTIGATED BY MULTIPHOTON MICROSCOPY IN COMBINATION WITH FLUORESCENT REPORTER PROTEINS.   We have recently developed reporters for monitoring calcium influx and vesicle fusion in synaptic terminals and are using these to monitor synaptic activity in large populations of neurons within intact circuits.  We are particularly interested in the function of ribbon synapses in the retina, but also aim to investigate the retinal output received by neurons in the tectum.  The overall aim is to understand how these synapses transfer information contained within a visual stimulus.

<p>2.  THE MOLECULAR EVENTS INVOLVED IN EXOCYTOSIS AND ENDOCYTOSIS AT RIBBON SYNAPSES INVESTIGATED USING ISOLATED RETINAL NEURONS AND TOTAL INTERNAL REFLECTION FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY (TIRFM).  This technique allows the visualization of synaptic vesicles and fluorescent molecules within about 100 nm of the surface membrane.  We have generated fish that express fluorescent fusion proteins regulating vesicle behaviour at or near the active zone and are using these to monitor the vesicle cycle in real-time.   The basic aim is to better understand the processes that control the translocation and docking of vesicles before fusion, as well as the retrieval of vesicles after fusion

<p>Both positions are in the laboratory of Leon Lagnado in the Neurobiology Division at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge.  The projects use a combination of molecular biology, zebrafish genetics, advanced imaging methods and electrophysiology. Experience in at least one of these techniques would be required, together with the desire to learn one or more of the others.  A strong interest in the function of the nervous system is essential, and more specific interests in synapses, vision or zebrafish would be an advantage.  If you are interested please contact Leon  by e-mail with your CV and the names of two referees (<a href="mailto:LL1@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk">LL1@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk</a>).  Further information can be obtained by contacting Leon directly and from our website (<a href="http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/groups/LL/index.html">http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/groups/LL/index.html</a>).  Both positions are funded by the Wellcome Trust for a period up to five years.

<p>TREAT-OA (European Framework Program 7) represents a large-scale collaborative, integrated, trans-disciplinary project utilizing a resource of 28,000 OA phenotyped subjects with available genome-wide association scan data as well as leading basic science laboratories and technologies. The key scientific objectives of TREAT-OA are:

<p>- to identify genes and biochemical markers consistently associated with risk and progression of OA

<p>- define their function in the molecular pathways involved in disease aetiology

<p>- develop in vivo models by the use of transgenic animal laboratory OA model systems.

<p>Within this project we are currently looking for a post-doctoral fellow to join our research team focusing on the functional studies (item 2). Specifically, the work will involve identification and cloning and in situ studies of zebrafish orthologues of human disease genes. Next, gain and loss of function studies in the fish will be carried out to identify signaling pathways associated with those genes. Finally, generation of stable mutant fish lines and phenotypic analysis will be carried out on selected genes. The tools to perform this research project consist of advanced molecular embryology using zebrafish model, histology and analysis of gene expression by in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence and quantitative PCR.

<p>A successful candidate will have a prior training in the zebrafish developmental biology. Knowledge of the early fish development as well as advanced molecular biology would be an advantage.

Live imaging techniques are used provide new insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying how circuits form (see Mumm J.S. et al., 2006). Inducible targeted cellular ablation techniques (see, Curado S. et al., 2007) are being applied to study the function of specific neuronal subtypes and subcircuits. Because zebrafish have an innate capacity for regeneration, which extends even to the nervous system, targeted ablation can combined with large-scale genetic & chemical screens to develop degenerative disease modes and to identify factors which promote adult stem cell-based regenerative programs. This system can be applied to a multitude of cell/tissue types and thus provides an excellent opportunity for someone seeking to develop an independent regenerative research program.

<p><center><strong>(Syracuse University)</strong></center></p><br>
<p>Albertson Lab, Department of Biology, Syracuse University

<p>We are looking for exceptional students interested in studying the evolution of developmental mechanisms. Ph.D. positions are available for Fall 2008. Funding is guaranteed through teaching assistantships, with additional funding (i.e., research assistantships) pending.  Successful applicants will be able to participate in a variety of ongoing and future projects aimed at understanding the evolution of skeletal patterning. Several vertebrate taxa are currently being studied in the lab, including zebrafish, African cichlids and Antarctic icefishes.  The approach of the lab is to integrate studies in a laboratory model (i.e., zebrafish) and natural populations (i.e., cichlids) to understand the evolution of animal form and function. Methods of study include comparative embryology, developmental and molecular genetics, quantitative genetics, and morphometric shape analysis.

<p>For more information about specific projects in the lab please visit my website at <a href="http://albertsonlab.syr.edu/research.html">http://albertsonlab.syr.edu/research.html.</a>

<p>Faculty in the Biology Department at Syracuse University have a broad array of interests ranging from molecular, cellular and developmental biology to ecology and evolution. Furthermore, the close proximity of SU to several other excellent institutions including SUNY Environmental Science and Forestry, SUNY Upstate Medical Center, Cornell University and the University of Rochester, contributes to a strong and vibrant intellectual community that will facilitate a great graduate experience.   

<p>All prospective students are encouraged to contact Dr. Craig Albertson via e-mail (<a href=mailto:rcalbert@syr.edu>rcalbert@syr.edu</a>) and to complete a free on-line pre-application form available at <a href="http://biology.syr.edu/graduatestudies/graduatepreapp.html">http://biology.syr.edu/graduatestudies/graduatepreapp.html</a>
