A postdoctoral position is immediately available to study motoneuron diseases in zebrafish. The project focuses on Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), an autosomal recessive disease and the number one genetic cause of infant and toddler mortality.  The project will focus on elucidating the underlying biology of SMA using a zebrafish model (McWhorter et al., 2003). Our lab also works closely with Dr. Arthur Burghes an expert on the SMA mouse model allowing for a dynamic, cross-species approach to understanding this disease.  Persons with experience in molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, and imaging are encouraged to apply.  Previous experience with zebrafish is desirable, but not mandatory.</p>

<p><center><strong>(Center for Molecular Neurobiology - University of Hamburg, Germany)</strong></center></p><br>

<p>
A post-doctoral positions in zebrafish neurobiology is available at the
Center for Molecular Neurobiology at the University Hamburg to study cell
adhesion molecules in nervous system development, regeneration and
synaptic  plasticity.</p>

<p> Our previous work (for reviews see, for instance,
Dityatev and  Schachner, Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 4, 456-468 (2003); Kleene and
Schachner,  Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 5, 195-208 (2004) and <a href="http://www.zmnh.uni-hamburg.de">http://www.zmnh.uni-hamburg.de</a>)  demonstrated that cell interactions
depend on the finely tuned interplay of  recognition molecules at the cell
surface and in the extracellular matrix  and that not only the protein
backbone, but also glycans attached to the  protein backbone are required
for function via signal transduction.</p>

<p>Work in  this area has led to the
use of zebrafish and analyses of cell interactions  during development and
regeneration.  Recent experiments show that  recognition molecules, in
particular L1, are beneficial for development and  in enhancing
regenerative processes in spinal cord lesion paradigms in  zebrafish and
mice.  Furthermore, peptidomimetics and small organic  compounds for
carbohydrates and functionally important epitopes on L1 have  been and are
being developed that are presently tested in mouse and  zebrafish models
of neurodegeneration. Publications of the group are among  the 100 most
cited ones in the Neurosciences worldwide according to ISI as  monitored
in 2000-2003.</p>

<p>We are looking for enthusiastic and co-operative scientists with
experience  in working with zebrafish, for instance during development
using methods in  molecular biology, biochemistry, tissue culture, and/or
animal surgery to  engage in a multi-disciplinary approach with the goal
to apply our  knowledge in recognition molecule function in a very
powerful animal model  system, namely the zebrafish, to therapy in
neurodegenerative diseases in  humans. Send applications to Melitta

<p>One or two postdoctoral research positions are available to participate in the study of neuronal regeneration of the damaged zebrafish retina at the University of Notre Dame. We are using several different paradigms to cause the loss of different neuronal populations, including the light-induced loss of rod and cone photoreceptors (Vihtelic and Hyde (2000) J. Neurobiol. 44: 289-307). Gene microarray experiments have identified a number of candidate genes that are involved in specific stages of the regeneration response and additional microarray experiments are planned to identify candidates that are required for the regeneration of specific neuronal cell types. Genetic tools, such as the Cre-lox and Tet-on systems, are being developed to drive cell-specific and inducible expression of specific transgenes to analyze the regeneration response.</p>

<p>The lab consists of several postdocs and graduate students. Two technicians maintain the feeding and husbandry of the large zebrafish facility (approximately 3,500 tanks) daily. The lab is well-funded by both external grants and money provided by the University.</p>

<p>We are looking for talented individuals who may have experience in molecular biology, genetics, cell biology, genomics, biochemistry, developmental biology or related fields. Previous experience with zebrafish is desirable, but not mandatory. More experienced individuals may be considered to be hired at the non-tenure track Research Assistant Professor level.

<p><center><strong>(American University - Washington DC)</strong></center></p><br>

<p>Recently, conservation biologists have been investigating the usefulness of a relatively new tool,<b> fluctuating asymmetry (FA)</b>, for assessing the impact of environmental and genetic stresses on populations. One of the main advantages of FA is its increased sensitivity relative to other bioindicators. If effective, this tool could allow biologists to monitor populations and make recommendations before a severe problem arises, often without the high cost of other solutions.</p>

<p>I have a number of funded FA projects available for graduate students interested in obtaining their MS degree at American University. Study subjects include marine mammal and endangered species. The projects combine FA data with other measures of population health to determine, on a species-by-species basis, whether FA can be used to identify stressed populations before detrimental population decline occurs. </p>

<p>Funded positions include tuition, stipend and, if desired, hourly wages for work as a TA. Basics research support is also provided. If interested please contact:
Cathy Schaeff, <a href="mailto:schaeff@american.edu">schaeff@american.edu</a>.</p>

<p>Funded graduate positions also available for <b>Retinal Circuitry Research Project</b></p>

<p>This project examines physiology and neurobiology of neurons in the distal zebrafish retina focusing, in particular, on dopaminergic pathways. Techniques used in this study include whole-cell patch clamp and microdissection of retinal tissue. Please contact Victoria Connaughton for more information:<br>

<p>A postdoctoral position is available for 3 years to study the molecular, genetic and behavioural aspects of cell migration in development and disease using zebrafish as model system. The project will involve the generation of transgenic zebrafish lines expressing fluorescent markers in a temporal and cell-specific pattern. These lines will be used to follow migrating cells in their environment, test hypotheses on the signals, effectors and modulators of migration through molecular and genetic manipulations, and develop screens to study pathological migration events, such as those occurring in cancer.</p>
