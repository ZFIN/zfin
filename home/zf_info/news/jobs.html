<p>Diversity of sex determination in fish: functional genetic analysis of sex chromosomes in the platyfish Xiphophorus maculatus.

<p><b>Description of the project</b><br>
In contrast to the situation observed in mammals and birds, sex determination is hypervariable and evolves extremely rapidly in fish. This variability is potentially associated with the formation of new master sex-determining genes and new sex chromosomes. Hence, fish represent an outstanding model for the study of the evolution of sex determination, sex chromosomes and sex-linked traits.
Understanding the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms involved in the diversity of sex determination requires the identification of master genes controlling the sex of individuals. The only gene of this type identified so far in fish, dmrt1bY in the medaka, is present in only a restricted number of species. Due to the absence of recognizable sex chromosomes and sex-linked molecular markers, zebrafish and both pufferfishes Fugu and Tetraodon, with almost completely sequenced genomes, are not suitable for this type of analysis. Hence, new models are required to study sex determination in fish.

<p>The platyfish Xiphophorus maculatus is an aquarium fish reputed for its use in cancer research. Due to the availability of numerous molecular markers delimiting the sex-determining region, this species is particularly suitable to study the control of sexual dimorphism. Our major goal is to identify through positional cloning and to characterize at both functional and evolutionary levels the master sex-determining gene of the platyfish, as well as other sex chromosomal genes involved in pigmentation, sexual development and melanoma formation. Bacterial artificial chromosome contigs from both X and Y chromosomes have been already constructed and are being sequenced to completion in collaboration with the Genoscope sequencing center. The expression, function, genomic localization and evolution of the identified genes will be studied in platyfish and other fish models including killifish, medaka and zebrafish, as well as in guppies and mollies, which are important biological models closely related to the platyfish. This study has implications for cancer research through the identification of genes involved in the formation of melanoma, as well as for aquaculture, for which molecular sexing and manipulation of sex determination are important economical challenges.

<p><b>Candidat profile</b><br>
The candidate will analyse at the functional level the genes identified on the sex chromosomes of the platyfish. He/she should be highly motivated by research in the field of \"Evo/devo\" and be experienced in methods used in fish developmental biology. Knowledge in bioinformatics and molecular evolution would be of advantage. The candidate should be able to work autonomously and demonstrate interest in pluridisciplinary scientific interactions inside as well as outside of the institute.<br>

<p>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), which is part of NIH, has a job opening for a program director, specifically in the area of developmental biology.  This is a wonderful opportunity to help nurture a strong portfolio of grants that focus on development of the kidney and genitourinary tract in models (including zebrafish!) and in humans, and on repair of damaged organs.  This would be a comfortable setting for a model organism biologist; indeed, we are trying to replace a Drosophila geneticist, who recently moved on in the NIH world.

<br>The work done in Bath will form part of the thesis submitted in the home institution
<br>The application will have the support of the supervisor(s) in the home institution
<br>Although visits can be from 3 months to one year, preference will usually
be given to longer stays (to maximise potential benefits)
</blockquote>

<p>Application will be considered and approved by the Management Team
of the CRM.

<p>Contact me in the first instance, to discuss project ideas, etc. If we decide to proceed we will then need:

<blockquote>
<br>1. A CV (including contact details for 2 referees, one of these will usually be their current supervisor) of the student

<p>Zebrafish Neurobiology/Live Microscopy
 
<p>A position is available within a group which works on the neurobiology of modulatory neurontransmitter systems in vertebrates, including zebrafish. The general research questions in the laboratory are related to organization and mode of action of aminergic and peptidergic systems in normal and diseased brain. This particular project involves application of high-resolution 3D imaging systems on brain aminergic and peptidergic systems in zebrafish brain of normal and mutated fish, and development of a live imaging system of neurons to study the mode of function of modulatory transmitters, especially histamine. Fish from mutation screens will also be analysed to find abnormalities in important neuronal systems using confocal and two-photon microscopes. The instrumentation includes fully equipped confocal/2P microscopes (Leica SP2 AOBS). The group has equipment for quantitative behavioural and molecular analyses of the fish (e.g. quantitative PCR, protein chemistry, HPLC). Microinjection systems are used for translation inhibition and generation of transgenic fish. The laboratories are located in the Neuroscience Center, Institute of Biomedicine/Anatomy, Biomedicum Helsinki. An ideal candidate has a PhD and thorough training in advanced microscopic methods, image analysis and neurobiology.  High motivation and good communication skills are important.
 
<p>Salary will be negotiated according to qualifications based on the new governmental salary system. Initial appointment for a qualified postdoctoral candidate can be made for one year, and extended at maximum for the full four-year funding period.

<p>A postdoctoral position is available in the lab of Dr. Gage Crump. The broad goal of the lab is to understand, at the molecular and cellular level, how organs acquire precise three-dimensional shapes. To this aim, we study the larval zebrafish head skeleton, where positional information and local epithelial signaling centers interact to shape a small set of unique cartilages. We use a wide range of techniques that include forward genetics, high-resolution time-lapse imaging, and transplantation.
 
<p>Current projects in the lab include the following:
 
<p>1.)  Understanding how positional information translates into skeletal shape by characterizing a set of new mutants with A-P and D-V patterning defects.
 
<p>2.)  Development of the pharyngeal endodermal epithelium and how the endoderm in turn induces local shaping of the head skeleton.
 
<p>3.)  Using developmental knowledge to regenerate cartilages and bones of specific shapes.
