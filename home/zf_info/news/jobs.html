study the role of lipid metabolism and phospholipase signaling during zebrafish
development using real-time optical biosensors. Projects are directed towards the
identification of genetic pathways which regulate lipid metabolism in the context of organ
development with potential importance in human colon cancer. Mutagenesis screens using
fluorescent lipids exploit the unique advantages of the zebrafish for coupling genetic
analyses to real-time imaging of enzymatic function. Mutations revealed by these reagents,
will lead to the identification of genes that regulate physiological and developmental
processes that cannot be assayed using conventional screening strategies. Examples include
genes that regulate lipid and prostaglandin metabolism, intestinal and liver transport and
development of the biliary tract. Identification of these genes has important implications
for cancer research and research related to diseases of the liver, intestine and
cardiovascular system. This position will include phenotypic screens for lipid processing
mutants, mapping candidate genes, positional cloning and gene isolation efforts.

<hr>

<p><font face="AGaramond">A postdoctoral position is available for at least two years in
the laboratory of Gunter Wagner at Yale University. In this lab, we focus on </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) using a comparative approach to identifying molecular differences that are
  associated with major morphological innovations and <br>
  (2) employing experimental approaches that test for the functional significance of these
  molecular differences. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Specifically, we focus on the genetic basis for the origin of the autopodium
(hand/foot) in tetrapod evolution. The successful applicant will work on a project that
integrates understanding the molecular evolution and expression of <em>Hox</em> genes that
pattern fish fins and tetrapod limbs and the progression of morphological changes that are
associated with the fin-limb transition (e.g. Blanco et al., 1998 <em>Dev Genes &amp; Evol</em>
<strong>208</strong>:175-87; Chiu et al., 2000a, <em>Dev Genes &amp; Evol</em> <strong>210</strong>:105-09;
--2000b <em>Mol Phylog &amp; Evo</em>l <strong>17</strong>:305-16). The successful
applicant will also participate in a collaborative effort to discover and comparatively
analyze genes that are specific to the autopodium using gene-expression profiling
approaches. It is expected that the candidate has an intellectual commitment to the
problems of developmental evolution and has demonstrated experience in molecular and
developmental biology techniques including at least PCR, cloning, in situ hybridization,
and analysis of DNA sequences. </p>

<p>Although not a requirement, experience in any of the following areas will be
advantageous: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) yeast based one- or two-hybrid system<br>
  (2) mammalian cell tissue culture<br>
  (3) transgenic zebrafish, frog, and/or mouse</p>

objectives, and the names and contact information of three references to: </p>

<p><font face="AGaramond">Two postdoctoral positions are available immediately in
Christine and Bernard Thisse's lab at the Institut de Génétique et de Biologie
Moléculaire et Cellulaire (IGBMC) in Strasbourg, France.</p>

<p>Successful candidates will work on the establishment of the &quot;molecular
anatomy&quot; of the zebrafish embryo using genes identified in a large scale in situ
hybridization screen actually performed in our laboratory.</p>

<p>The main goal of this project is to release data from the in situ screen to public by
building a gene expression database which will be included in the zebrafish database ZFIN
(Eugene, USA). Analysis of 6,800 cDNAs has already provide us with more than 1,700
expression patterns.</p>

<p>Postdocs will work in collaboration with 3 technicians and 2 PIs and will be in charge
of the analysis and documentation of gene expression data. This work will be the first
step toward a functional analysis of novel gene activities involved in the control of
early embryonic development (For example of such studies see : <em>Development</em> <strong>124</strong>,
4253-4264, <em>Development</em> <strong>126</strong>, 229-240, <em>Nature</em> <strong>403</strong>,
425-427).</p>

<p>The research group is located at the IGBMC (<a href="http://www-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/">http://www-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/</a>)
in Strasbourg, Illkirch, in a large Institute covering the fields of developmental
biology, transcriptional regulation, human genetics, immmunology, structural biology. This
Institute possesses all new and highly performant core facilities for high thoughput
molecular, embryological techniques as well as a large zebrafish facility.</p>

<hr>

<p>The Research Group of Dr. Axel Meyer at the University of Konstanz has positions
available for two PhD students and/or a Postdoctoral Researcher. </p>

<p>These positions are part of a well-funded project entitled &#145;Gene and genome
duplications and the evolution of novel gene functions&#145;. The goals of the project are
to identify duplicated genes, particularly those produced during ancient genome
duplication events, to test hypotheses explaining the retention and evolution of
duplicates and to investigate the role of gene and genome duplication in major
evolutionary transitions and radiations with emphasis on the zebrafish, <em>Fugu</em> and
cichlid fishes. A broad knowledge of computers and programming is desirable. Knowledge of
programming languages such as Perl, Python and/or Java would be advantageous. Successful
candidates will join a large internationally well-known research group. </p>

<p>The University is in the beautiful city of Konstanz on the Bodensee in southern
Germany. Zurich is approximately one hour south and Stuttgart is a one and a half hour
drive to the north. The positions are funded for a period of 2 years with salaries
according to German BAT2 or Bat2/2 salary scale (about DM 2,500-3,500 or $ 1,250 or
1,750/month). Extensions are no problem. </p>
