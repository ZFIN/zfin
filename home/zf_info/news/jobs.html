<p><b>Postdoc position available in zebrafish</b></p>


<p>(April 1, 2005 or before)</p>

<p>The Institute of Research in Ophthalmology (IRO) is looking for a talented young PhD to setup a new developmental program in zebrafish.  In this position, he/she will be responsible to dissect the molecular mechanisms implicated in the development of the eye and, using the zebrafish as a model organism, to investigate the role of the genes identified in human patients by our linkage & mapping group. The initial program is financed for a period of three years and, if successful, the candidate will then be able to develop his/her own group.</p>


<p>The candidate should have good experience with zebrafish and developmental studies. Strong ties with other zebrafish groups are an advantage.</p>

<p>IRO, a research institute affiliated to the University of Lausanne, is located in Sion, in the center of the Swiss Alps, about 100 km from Lausanne. You can access our web page for further information (<a href="http://www.irovision.ch">http://www.irovision.ch/</a>).</p>

<p>JOB DESCRIPTION: POSTDOC IN MOLECULAR GENETICS/DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY AT THE MEDICAL FACULTY, UNIVERSITY OF TROMS&Oslash;, NORWAY</p>

<p>At the Medical Faculty, University of Troms&oslash;, there is a  post doc position open for 3 years in the field of molecular genetics/developmental biology. The position is a part of a collaboration between research groups at the Institute of Pharmacy and the Institute of Medical Biology, and it plays a central part in the establishment of  zebrafish as a model system. The project is a part of the research strategy of the Medical Faculty.</p>

<p>The involved research groups study the transcription factor Pax6 and the nuclear protein SPBP, in addition to the atypical protein kinase C isoforms lambda and zeta and their interaction partners. These are all important factors for transcriptional regulation and cell signalling, maybe best illustrated by their association with cancer and other diseases. To gain further information of the biological function of the gene products we study, their target genes and interaction partners, zebrafish will be used as a model-system. Knowledge about zebrafish/fish development (embryology, anatomy and physiology) and/or molecular genetic techniques such as immunohistochemistry and RNA in situ hybridisation is required.</p>

<p>To be considered for the position the candidate needs to have a PhD.</p>

<p>A post doc is paid according to the state salary scale, code1352.</p>

<p>A postdoctoral position and a research assistant/associate position are
available to study kidney development and human diseases in both zebrafish
and Medaka.  Ongoing projects include using cystic kidney mutants to study
the primary cause and mechanisms of cyst formation.  The studies will lead
us to understand the signal transduction of polycystic kidney disease and
will help find clues for disease therapy.</p>

<p>The successful applicant for the postdoctoral position will have training in
molecular biology and/or developmental biology, or preferably both.
Zebrafish and/or Medaka experience is preferred but training will also be
provided.  Recent PhD. Graduates, or those close to graduating are
encouraged to apply.  There is NIH funding available for the postdoctoral
position although the successful applicant will also be expected to apply
for fellowships.</p>

<p>For the research assistant position, a B.S. in Biology with prior experience
in molecular biology, biochemistry or embryology is preferred. You will
perform various laboratory procedures, including DNA, RNA protein isolation
and manipulation, PCR, gel electrophoresis, and whole mount in situ
hybridization.  You will also handle fish, setup crosses, collect eggs and
stage embryos.</p>

<p>A postdoctoral position is available in the Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine. Our lab uses zebrafish to explore the biology and genetics of growth/size control. For example, we have identified zebrafish mutants which demonstrate fin overgrowth. Growth of the wild type zebrafish fin is tightly regulated, thus dissecting the biology of growth control pathways through mutant analysis will provide insight into normal growth control checkpoints. For an example of this work, see Goldsmith et al., Dev Bio, 259(2):303-317.</p>

<p>We are also interested in the relationship between nutritional status and growth. Although growth of adult wild type fish is exquisitely sensitive to nutritional status, this nutrition checkpoint can be bypassed under certain conditions (e.g. fin regeneration). Mutant screens have just been initiated to help explore the role of nutrition in the overall hierarchy of pathways regulating growth.</p>

<p>2 Postdoctoral Positions<br>
Vascular Biology Program, Children's Hospital Boston</p>

<p>We are seeking two postdoctoral fellows to work on an NIH funded project starting in September, 2004.  We are a new group in the Program in Vascular Biology headed by Dr. Judah Folkman, at the Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School. We use genetic, chemical genetic and molecular approaches to dissect signaling pathways in the zebrafish, with the goal of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying angiogenesis in an intact vertebrate organism.</p>

<p>An example of our work is found in Chan et al., 2002, "Dissection of angiogenic signaling using a chemical genetic approach", Cancer Cell, vol.1: 257-267.  We have recently isolated a series of new angiogenic mutants from a novel genetic screen in heterozygous zebrafish embryos using a small molecule kinase inhibitor.  These mutants display vascular phenotypes as homozygous recessives.  Projects include characterization and positional cloning of these angiogenic mutants as well as development of transgenic lines.   This project is ideal for new graduates interested in using the zebrafish for cancer-relevant signal transduction studies.  Salary will be based on Children's Hospital guidelines.</p>  

<p>Qualifications:   Ph.D. training in molecular biology or genetics.  Zebrafish experience is preferred but training will also be provided.</p>
