<div>
    At the MRC Centre for Developmental and Biomedical Genetics (CDBG) at the University of Sheffield, biologists and hospital doctors have teamed up to use zebrafish embryos to learn more about human disease. The Fish For Science website introduces visitors to the model organism zebrafish and explains how the genetically modified fish with fluorescent cells and organs is an essential part of research in discovering new treatments for disease.

<p><b><i><a href="http://bioeyes.org">Project BioEYES</a></i> - A unique, interactive site designed for students to learn about the fields of science and medicine by becoming scientists in their own classrooms.</b></p>

<p>Project BioEYES  is a K-12 science education program that provides classroom- and outdoor-based learning opportunities through the use of live zebrafish. Project BioEYES is designed to incorporate teacher empowerment and provides professional development seminars and a co-teaching experience with trained university science consultants, called outreach educators. BioEYES has several locations throughout the U.S. and Australia. For more information, please visit <a href="http://bioeyes.org/">bioeyes.org.</a></p>

<p><b><i><a href="http://www.uoneuro.uoregon.edu/k12/zfk12.html">Zebrafish K-12</a></i> - Facts and information about "zebrafish", the organism, and "zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>)", the popular model used for developmental and genetics research.</b></p>

<p>This site contains facts and information on zebrafish and zebrafish research, images of the developmental stages of the zebrafish and links to other online resources, including commercial suppliers and other K-12 sites. In addition, the site contains an online manual, <a href="http://www.neuro.uoregon.edu/k12/linksabzs.html">Zebrafish ABZs</a>, designed for those interested in using zebrafish for teaching scientific research or for simple projects.</p>

<p><b><i><a href="http://www.zfic.org/">Zebrafish In The Classroom</a></i> - Designed to be a resource for teachers and students who are using zebrafish in undergraduate courses.</b></p>

<p>This site contains protocols for techniques ranging from the raising and maintenance of zebrafish, to fixing embryos for microscopy, to molecular techniques used for the visualization of RNA and proteins. In addition, there are experimental protocols for the classroom and virtual experiments that can be carried out online when a laboratory setting is not available.</p>
