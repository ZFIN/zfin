<p><br>
ZFIN, the zebrafish model organism database, seeks scientific curators and bioinformaticians to join our dynamic, interactive  team of biologists and computer scientists at the University of Oregon in Eugene, OR. . </p>

<p> <b>Scientific Curators</b> <br> ZFIN curators acquire, evaluate and analyze information about zebrafish gene structures, expression patterns, and mutant phenotypes. They integrate information from disparate sources and interact with research laboratories to facilitate electronic submission of data. Curators also participate in database and interface design by providing biological perspectives for new database content and displays. Applicants should have a Ph.D., or M.S. with appropriate experience, in molecular biology or genetics with experience in molecular genetics and, preferably, zebrafish biology.  ZFIN has recently begun a collaboration with the Sanger Institute to annotate the whole-genome sequence, so applicants with experience in genomics are especially encouraged to apply. </p>


<p><b>Bioinformatics Database Administrator</b><br>

ZFIN database administrators collaborate with biologists to design and implement the required infrastructure for the integration of zebrafish genes, expression patterns, mutant phenotypes and whole genome sequence data.  Applicants should have a thorough understanding of logical and physical database design and administration, the ability to monitor and troubleshoot a web-accessible database, and the ability to administer an Apache web site. Applicants should have a M.S.in Computer Science or a B.S. with appropriate experience. Strong preference will be given to candidates with knowledge of biology and/or experience in connecting databases to the web.  
</p>


<p> <b>Bioinformatics Analyst/Programmer</b> <br>

ZFIN analysts assist in the design, implementation and evaluation of web based applications for biological research.  Applications support the integration, consolidation and interpretation of zebrafish gene structures, expression patterns and mutant phenotypes.  Applicants should have a thorough understanding of bioinformatics database systems; familiarity with Perl, Java, SQL; UNIX experience; strong communication skills.  Applicants should have a B.S.in Computer Science, Mathematics and/or Biology with appropriate experience, M.S. preferred.  Strong preference will be given to candidates with knowledge of biology
