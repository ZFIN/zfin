ZDB-ALT-100526-2|nel fr22 mutants have a T>A transversion within the coding region, 17 bp upstream of the end of exon 55 (8541T>A). This has a two-fold effect, generating a nonsense mutation Y2847* and&nbsp;&nbsp;converting the genomic sequence from 8538-gtat-8541 sequence to 8538-gtaa-8541, a consensus splice site. As a result, two transcripts (M1 and M2) are generated, M1 spliced at the WT location, and M2 spliced due to the novel splice donor site. In M1 the T>A yields an in-frame nonsense mutation.&nbsp;&nbsp;M2 transcript lacks the last 20 nt of exon 55, creating a frameshift predicted to introduce 10 erroneous amino acids followed by a stop codon.

ZDB-ALT-101008-17|notch3 fh332 harbors a nonsense mutation that introduces a premature stop codon at amino acid position 669 within the 8th Notch3 EGF repeat. The mutation is expected to generate a non-functional truncated protein lacking most of the extracellular and all of the transmembrane and intracellular domains of Notch3. fh332/fh332 homozygous embryos and larvae developed at normal speed and without apparent morphological defects, although the mutation was lethal before adulthood.<br>Reference:  <a href="https://zfin.org/cgi-bin/webdriver?MIval=aa-pubview2.apg&OID=ZDB-PUB-130729-10">Alunni et al.
