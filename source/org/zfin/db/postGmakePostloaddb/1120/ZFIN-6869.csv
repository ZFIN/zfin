Quantitative real-time PCR showed rpgrip1 mRNA was decreased by about 85% in 5 dpf rpgrip1−/− embryos when compared to wildtype siblings, confirming that NMD was most likely occurring.

We could obtain drl-kz2 homozygous embryos by PCR-based genotyping. When these mutant embryos were genotyped by sequencing, only mutant sequence was observed (No merged waveforms with WT or others). Since genotyping primers also recognize all three genes, we speculate that the kz2 mutant contains the same mutation in each of three drl genes. However, we did not confirm the sequence of each gene due to the dificulty to separate these three genes. We cannot exclude the possibility that there is a big deletion in one or two of drl genes in the kz2 mutant.",allele,
