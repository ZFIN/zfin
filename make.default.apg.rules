#
# Include file to be included at the end of Makefiles that have app pages
# and that can use the default set of rules defined in this include file.
#
# See make.default.rules for the include file to use with standard makefiles
# that don't work with app pages.
#
# Note that not every makefile can include one of the default rule files.
# If there is anything non-standard about any of the rules in a makefile
# then that makefile should not include either of the rules.
#
# This include file expects to have the calling makefile define these 
# variables.
#
#  TOP        This must be defined.  This file also expects $(TOP)/make.include
#             to already have been included.
#  TARGETDIR  This MUST be defined.
#  SUBDIRS    This can be defined, undefined, or defined and empty.
#  GENERICS   This can be defined, undefined, or defined and empty.
#  STATICS    This can be defined, undefined, or defined and empty.
#
# For the last 3, undefined, and defined and empty produce the same results.
#
# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# !! See $(TOP)/Makefile and $(TOP)/make.include for a full explanation !!
# !! of the makefile hierarchy this makefile is a part of, and of the   !!
# !! format and conventions used in this makefile.                      !!
