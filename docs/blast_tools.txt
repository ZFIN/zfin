Motivation:
- our internal accessions not in other databases
- should be able to blast our transcripts against other databases 

Current method:
- use javascript to open correctly populated query string into new window (accession, etc.)


Proposed method for internal accessions:
- have the internal accession go to a page (externalBlastTag2.tag) that loads the sequence and then redirects with a populated sequence to the correct page:
  - don't have to load the entire sequence in the page for every pull-down
