# Include file to be included at the end of Makefiles that DO NOT have app 
# pages and that can use the default set of rules defined in this include file.
#
# See make.default.apg.rules for the include file to use with standard 
# makefiles that DO work with app pages.
#
# Note that not every makefile can include one of the defualt rule files.
# If there is anything non-standard about any of the rules in a makefile
# then that makefile should not include either of the rules.
#
# This include file expects to have the calling makefile define these 
# variables.
#
#  TOP        This must be defined.  This file also expects $(TOP)/make.include
#             to already have been included.
#  TARGETDIR  This MUST be defined.
#  SUBDIRS    This can be defined, undefined, or defined and empty.
#  GENERICS   This can be defined, undefined, or defined and empty.
#  STATICS    This can be defined, undefined, or defined and empty.
#
# For the last 3, undefined, and defined and empty produce the same results.
