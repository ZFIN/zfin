<p>This document is one of several that describe the Zebrafish Information
Network, or ZFIN.  This document introduces ZFIN and the rest of the 
documentation.

<!-- =================================================================== -->
<!-- ========= ZFIN ==================================================== -->
<!-- =================================================================== -->

<h1 class="zdoc"><a name="ZFIN">ZFIN</a></h1>

<p>ZFIN is an acronym for the Zebrafish Information Network, a 
<a href="http://zfin.org">web site</a> of information about zebrafish 
for biologists around the world.  The site contains all manner of information
about zebrafish, from care and feeding, to where a particular gene has 
been mapped on which chromosome using which mapping technique.

<p>Some of the information, such as care and feeding, is stored in static
pages.  Other information, such as genetic mapping results, are stored in
a database and pages describing that information are generated dynamically
in response to user queries.  


<!-- =================================================================== -->
<!-- ========= ZFIN Documentation ====================================== -->
<!-- =================================================================== -->

<h1 class="zdoc"><a name="ZFIN Documentation">ZFIN Documentation</a></h1>

<p>You are reading the "ZFIN Documentation", such as it is.  It consists of
a hierarchy of HTML files.  Our goal is to eventually include all documents
about ZFIN in this HTML hierarchy.  However, not all documentation is (or 
should be) in this tree.  Much of the documentation about the implementation
is stored in the web site files themselves.  There is a lot of documentation
in the 
<a href="impl.html#Makefiles and the ZFIN_WWW Source Tree">makefiles</a> 
that are used to produce the web site.  This is in keeping with the principle
that it is best to store documentation about code as close to the code 
itself as possible.  This increases the likelihood that the documentation
will stay up to date.
Another excellent source of documentation for ZFIN is 
<a href="http://zfinwinserver1.uoregon.edu/fogbugz/">FogBUGZ</a>, 
a project management / defect tracking tool used at ZFIN.  
See the <a href="#FogBUGZ">FogBUGZ section</a> for more details.


<p>The documentation is split into a few large files, rather than one 
monolithic file, or hundreds of small files.  This middle approach is a
tradeoff between the advantages and disadvantages of either extreme.  
Having a 
few large files instead of hundreds of smaller ones 
makes it easier to search and to print the documentation.
Having a few large files broken down along functional lines, rather than
one large file will hopefully make the documentation easier to read.


<!-- ========= Where to Find This Documentation ======================== -->

<h2 class="zdoc"><a name="Where To Find This Documentation">
                          Where To Find This Documentation</a></h2>

<p>This documentation is meant to be read in a browser.  It can be viewed 
from any browser <i>anywhere in the world</i> with this URL:

<div class="urlline">
<a href="http://mirror.zfin.org/zfin_doc/">http://mirror.zfin.org/zfin_doc/</a>
</div>

<p>However, this documentation, with the exception of the 
<a href="db.html">database design</a> section, is not meant for general
public consumption.  Then why is the aboe URL open to the world?  We 
frequently give access to the ZFIN documentation to specific people 
outside of ZFIN such as funders or staff at other model organism databases.

<p>In addition, the ZFIN documentation can be read from a restricted set of
IP addresses (campus plus selected others) by appending "/zfin_doc/" to the
end of any <a href="impl.html#Development DB Matrix">ZFIN test web site URL</a>.
For example, 
<a href="http://albino.zfin.org/zfin_doc/">http://albino.zfin.org/zfin_doc/</a>.

<h2 class="zdoc"><a name="How To Read This Documentation">
                          How To Read This Documentation</a></h2>

<p>What parts of the documentation you should read depends on what your 
general role is in the group, and on what particular tasks you perform.

<p>However, regardless of your role or the tasks you perform, everyone 
should read at least the <a href="intro.html">Introduction</a> section.



<h3 class="zdoc"><a name="Biologists">Biologists</a></h3>

<p>The relevant sections for biologists are:

<!-- ========= How To Update This Documentation ======================== -->

<h2 class="zdoc"><a name="How To Update This Documentation">
             How To Update This Documentation</a></h2>

<p>There are 2 main ways to update this documentation.  Which one you use
depends on how comfortable you are with Unix, and how much you know about 
<a href="impl.html#Source Code Control and CVS">CVS</a>.  This discussion
assumes that biologists are not comfortable with Unix and CVS and that 
technologists are.


<h3 class="zdoc"><a name="Biologists Update">Biologists</a></h3>

<p>How the update is done depends on which section you are updating.
<table>
 <tr>
   <td align="right" valign="top"><b><a href="curation.html">Curation</a></b>
   <td>To update the curation document, pull the document into 
       whatever web page authoring tool you are used to (e.g. FrontPage,
       DreamWeaver) and edit it.  When you are done with your updates, 
       e-mail the updated page to a technologist (probably Dave C.), and
       they will put it back in to the documentation.
 <tr>
   <td align="right" valign="top"><b>All other sections</b>
   <td>Same as for curation except for the last step.  When
       you e-mail the updated file to a technologist you should also 
       include a list of what sections were changed.
       Unlike for the curation document, the technologist 
       will not do a wholesale replacement of the file with the updated file.
       Web page authoring tools are notorious for converting readable simple
       HTML files into obscure, over-tagged, and difficult to decipher HTML
       files.  The curation document will be updated mainly be people using 
       such tools.
       However, all the other documents will be mostly updated by 
       technologists working directly in HTML, and we want to keep those 
       files as clean as possible.
</table>


<h3 class="zdoc"><a name="Technologists Update">Technologists</a></h3>  

<p>Technologists use the same process to update all the HTML files.
The documentation is part of the <a href="impl.html#ZFIN Commons">Commons</a>
<a href="impl.html#Source Code Control and CVS">CVS</a> project.
To edit documentation files, 
first <a href="impl.html#CVS checkout">checkout</a> the 
<a href="impl.html#ZFIN Commons">Commons</a>
project, <a href="impl.html#CVS edit">edit</a> the files, and then 
<a href="impl.html#CVS commit">commit</a> them.  
Finally, talk to Dave C. to get the
updates posted back to the ZFIN Commons directory.


<h4 class="zdoc"><a name="Figures">Figures</a></h4>

<p>The figures in this documentation were created with the Unix <kbd>xfig</kbd>
utility.  <kbd>xfig</kbd> is a drawing program capable of exporting files 
into a number of
formats, including GIF, which is what the figures you see in these documents 
are.  Since the 
figures were created with a Unix utility, they can only be updated by 
people who are comfortable with Unix, which means 
<a href="#Technologists Update">technologists</a>.
The <a href="Products/xfig.html"><kbd>xfig</kbd> man page</a> and the
<a href="Products/xfig-howto.pdf"><i>Using XFig</i></a> manual are good
sources of information on how to use <kbd>xfig</kbd>.

<p>The figures are stored in subdirectories hung off the main directory.
Each HTML document has its own subdirectory for figures.  The versions
of the files that are displayed in the doc end in <kbd>.gif</kbd>.  
The versions 
of the files that can be edited with <kbd>xfig</kbd> end in <kbd>.fig</kbd>.

<p>The <kbd>.fig</kbd> and <kbd>.gif</kbd> files are controlled by 
<a href="impl.html#Source Code Control and CVS">CVS</a>, 
just like the HTML 
files.  The process for updating them is the same as that for HTML files,
with a little extra work:
<ol>
 <li>Using CVS, <a href="impl.html#CVS checkout">checkout</a> the 
   <a href="impl.html#ZFIN Commons">Commons</a> project 
   (if you haven't already done so).
 <li><a href="impl.html#CVS edit">CVS edit</a> both the <kbd>.fig</kbd>
   and <kbd>.gif</kbd> versions of the figure file you want to update.
 <li>Update the <kbd>.fig</kbd> file using <kbd>xfig</kbd>.
 <li><a href="impl.html#CVS commit">CVS commit</a> the <kbd>.fig</kbd> file.
 <li>Run <kbd>xfig</kbd> on the committed <kbd>.fig</kbd> file, and 
   Export it as a GIF, with Smooth turned on, and magnification set to
   at least 125%.
 <li><a href="impl.html#CVS commit">CVS commit</a> the .gif file.
 <li>Talk to Dave C. to get the committed files posted to the
<a href="impl.html#ZFIN Commons">ZFIN Commons</a> directories.
</ol>

<p>The <kbd>.fig</kbd> and <kbd>.gif</kbd> files need to be committed in
two separate steps because most of the <kbd>.fig</kbd> files contain
RCS flags that show the revision number of the figure.  Committing a
file changes its revision number.  Committing them
separately means the revision number shown in the <kbd>.gif</kbd> file will 
always agree with that in the <kbd>.fig</kbd> file.


<p>The figures were created with these settings:
<ul>
  <li>Grid Mode set to the finest level.
  <li>Text Size set to 8
  <li>Test Step set to 1.0
  <li>Text Font set to Helvetica
</ul>

<p>A Zoom of 1.5 works well when editing the figures.

<p>The GIFs were created from the <kbd>xfig</kbd> drawings by exporting them:
<ul>
  <li>Select Export from the File menu.
  <li>Set Language to GIF.
  <li>Select Smooth.
  <li>Set Magnif to at least 125%.  Bigger is better.
    Anything smaller will not be readable as a GIF.  The diagrams you see
    in these documents were created with magnifications of 125% or 140%.
  <li>Hit the Export button at the bottom.
</ul>


<h4 class="zdoc"><a name="Database Documentation">Database Documentation</a></h4>

<p>The database documentation is divided into 2 different parts:

<ul>
  <li><a href="db.html">db.html</a>:  This contains 
    database wide documentation, such as descriptions of ZDB ID formats,
    source versus data issues, and database functions.  It also contains
    a pointer to the 
    <a href="Database/DataModel/index.htm">ER/Studio database documentation</a>.
  <li><a href="Database/DataModel/index.htm">ER/Studio database documentation</a>:
    This contains ER diagrams of the entire database and subareas of the 
    database, and detailed descriptions of tables and columns.
</ul>

<p>The db.html file is updated in <a href="#Technologists Update">the same 
way</a> as other ZFIN documentation.  The ER/Studio doc is updated in an
entirely different fashion, and the rest of this section deals with how to
do that. 

<p><b>Note:</b> This section does <i>not</i> talk about how to update 
documentation within the ER/Studio product itself.  For details on how to
do that, see 
<a href="http://zfinwinserver1.uoregon.edu/fogbugz/default.asp?pg=pgEditBug&amp;command=view&amp;ixBug=46">FogBUGZ case 46</a>.
This section describes how to generate HTML reports from ER/Studio and then
get them placed so they can be read from the ZFIN web site.

<ol>
 <li>First, in order to even do this, you must have a PC that has 
  ER/Studio on it.  As of 2004/01, Dave and Sierra's PCs have ER/Studio,
  and the <a href="impl.html#FogBUGZ Server">FogBUGZ server</a> 
  in room 333 also has ER/Studio.<br><br>

 <li>In order to generate the Reports in the right place you must first 
  set the Reports directory.  In ER/Studio, get to the Options page:

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tools &rarr; Options &rarr; Directories

  <p>Set the "Intranet Site Root" to an Acme Network Place that contains a
  checked out copy of the <a href="impl.html#ZFIN Commons">Commons</a> CVS 
  project.  It should point at the "doc/Database/DataModel" subdirectory.
  For example, on Dave's machine the "Intranet Site Root" is set to 

  <div class="fileline">
  \\acme.cs.uoregon.edu\research\zusers\clements\Zfin\Commons\doc\Database\DataModel
  </div>

  <br>
 </li>
 <li><p>To generate a report of the production model, first open the production
  model in ER/Studio.  The production model is at:

  <div class="fileline">
  Commons/doc/Database/ERStudio/Reference/Production.DM1
  </div>

  <br>
 </li>
 <li>Then generate a report:

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tools &rarr; Generate Reports ...

  <p>Under the "Wizard Quick Launch" section hit the "Load File..." button and
  set it to 

  <div class="fileline">
  Commons/doc/Database/ERStudio/Reports/FullHTML.rpo
  </div>

  <p>Then hit the "Next" button.  This may come up and warn you that the 
  directory already exists.  This will be the case if you have generated a 
  report before.  Press "Yes".
  <br>
 </li>
 <li>The next page in the ER/Studio Report Wizard (page 2 of 4) lists what 
  objects from the database you want to include in the report, and what you
  want to know about them.  The selections you see here came from the 
  "Wizard Quick Launch" file you selected on the previous page.  Accept them
  as is and press "Next".
  <br><br>
 </li>
 <li>The next page in the ER/Studio Report Wizard (page 3 of 4) lists what
  quality and zoom you want for the images, and what the logo, report title
  and description for the report should be.  I spent a fair amount of time 
  trying to figure out what minimum zoom (80%) and quality (100%) settings 
  could be used and still have the diagrams be readable.  I have also tried to
  add a Description here, but if I then save that back to the Quick Launch
  File, it corrupts the file.  So you can add a description here, but think
  twice (or thrice) before saving it.  Accept the settings on this page 
  and hit "Next".
  <br><br>
 </li>
 <li>The fourth and final page basically lists what will show up on the title
  page of the report.  I would really like to be able to set the Modified date
  here, but I can't figure out how.  I am not sure if the version is useful
  to us.  Perhaps we should set it to the date?  Anyway, accept the settings
  on this page, and hit "Finish".
  <br><br>
 </li>
 <li>This then displays a window showing the progress of the report generation.
  When the generating is complete the "Cancel" button changes to "Close" and
  ER/Studio opens a browser window with the report in it.  Close the window
  and then review the report in the browser to see if it is what you want.
  If it is then proceed to the next step.  If it isn't then go back into
  ER/Studio and either update the data model (or the report options) and  
  then regenerate the report.
  <br><br>
 </li>
 <li>You now have an HTML report that exists on your Unix filesystem in your
  checked out copy of the Commons directory.  You now need to copy that report
  to the "production" and "development" copies of the 
  Commons directory so the report is visible
  on the web.  The previous instructions were all run on your PC.  The remaining
  instructions are all run on Unix.
  <br><br>
 </li>
 <li><p>Get to the DataModel directory of your copy of the CVS Commons project.
  For me this is

  <div class="shellline">
  % cd Commons/doc/Database/DataModel
  </div>
  <br>
 </li>
 <li>The DataModel directory is a mixture of CVS controlled files (README) and 
  files that are generated by ER/Studio.  The files that are generated by 
  ER/Studio are not placed under CVS.  When ER/Studio generates the files and
  directories under the DataModel directory, it does not always make them
  world readable.  We want everything to be world readable:

  <div class="shell">
  % find . -exec chmod g+r,o+r {} \;
  % find . -type d -exec chmod o+x {} \;
  </div>
 </li>
 <li>Package the directory into a tar file.

  <div class="shell">
  % cd ..
  % tar cf DataModel.tar DataModel
  </div>
 </li>
 <li>Copy the new report into the "development" ZFIN commons directory so it
  can be seen from the ZFIN documentation.  As yourself on the 
  <a href="impl.html#Development Server">development server</a>:

  <div class="shell">
  % sudo cp DataModel.tar <a href="impl.html#/private/ZfinLinks">/private/ZfinLinks</a>/Commons/doc/Database
  % cd /private/ZfinLinks/Commons/doc/Database
  % sudo rm -rf DataModel
  % sudo tar xf DataModel.tar
  % sudo rm DataModel.tar
  </div>
 </li>

 <li>Copy the new report into the "production" ZFIN commons directory so it
  can be seen from the zfin.org web site.  As yourself on the 
  <a href="impl.html#Production Server">production server</a>:

  <div class="shell">
  % sudo cp DataModel.tar <a href="impl.html#/private/ZfinLinks">/private/ZfinLinks</a>/Commons/doc/Database
  % cd /private/ZfinLinks/Commons/doc/Database
  % sudo rm -rf DataModel
  % sudo tar xf DataModel.tar
  % sudo rm DataModel.tar
  </div>
 </li>
</ol>

<p>And you are done.

<!-- =================================================================== -->
<!-- ========= ZFIN Web Sites ========================================== -->
<!-- =================================================================== -->

<h1 class="zdoc"><a name="ZFIN Web Sites">ZFIN Web Sites</a></h1>

<p>The end product of ZFIN is a web site.  In most contexts that means
the production site, <a href="http://zfin.org">http://zfin.org</a>.
However, ZFIN also has several other types of sites for things like mirror 
sites, beta testing, and development.  The remainder of this section 
briefly introduces each type of ZFIN web site.
For information on what web sites are
implemented on which machines using which databases see the 
<a href="impl.html#Web Site / Database / Machine Matrix">
                   Web Site / Database / Machine Matrix</a>.


<!-- ========= Production Site ========================================= -->

<h2 class="zdoc"><a name="Production Site">Production Site</a></h2>

<p>When people talk about the ZFIN site, they are referring to the 
production ZFIN site at <a href="http://zfin.org">http://zfin.org</a>.
This is ZFIN's presentation to the world.
It has the latest and greatest version of the web site.  The biologists
do their curation on this web site.  No matter which 
<a href="impl.html#Machines and Informix Engines">physical server</a> the
production web site is running on, it is always accessed as
<a href="http://zfin.org">http://zfin.org</a>.

<p>The production web site normally resides on the
<a href="impl.html#Production Server">production server</a>.  However, when 
the production server 
is down for upgrades or maintenance, the production web site resides
on the <a href="impl.html#Development Server">development server</a>.  
The process for doing this swap is described in the 
<a href="admin.html#Moving zfin.org to a Different Machine">
Moving zfin.org to a Different Machine</a>
section.


<!-- ========= Pre-Production and Sandbox Site ========================= -->

<h2 class="zdoc"><a name="Pre-Production and Sandbox Site">
             Pre-Production and Sandbox Site</a></h2>

<p>ZFIN uses the 
<a href="http://almost.zfin.org">http://almost.zfin.org</a> site as its
final staging/testing site for updates before they are 
<a href="impl.html#Putting Changes Into Production">placed into production</a>.
ZFIN team members will often be asked to test something on this site as a 
final sanity check.  It also serves as a "sandbox" site where curators can 
try things
before trying them on <a href="http://zfin.org">http://zfin.org</a> to see
what happens.


<!-- ========= Beta Testing Site ======================================= -->

<h2 class="zdoc"><a name="Beta Testing Site">Beta Testing Site</a></h2>

<p>ZFIN sometimes makes new features available to the outside world for 
testing and evaluation before we put them into production.  We use the
<a href="http://test.zfin.org">http://test.zfin.org</a> site for this
purpose.  Access to the testing site is generally disallowed, but is
