Need to add a second chunk for rootdbs on embryonix -- filled because of sysadmin database
growth with upgrade to 11.10.FC2.  See addSysadmindbSpace.recipe for more details.

As informix on embryonix

 % cd /private/apps/apache/bin

 % sudo apachectl stop

 kill all tomcats

 % kill `ps -e | grep jsvc | egrep -v grep | awk '{print $1}'`
 
 % cd ~/informix/dev

 Find where there is free space to add a second chunk, preferably in the same partition
 as the current rootdbs.

 There is room in the current partition. (see old ZFIN doc on mirror for an updated chart of 
 space availability).  

 **Always** check and update this doc--seriously, its all we have in times
 of crisis to determine where we can add chunks. 

 % ln -s /dev/rdsk/c2t1d5s0 rootdbs_c2

 check permissions
 
 % ls -lL

     see that new file has crw-rw---- privledges and is owned by informix
     and is in the informix group
     -c means you are dealing with RAW disk.

     make sure if you do have to change permissions
     that you do g+w, g+r, o+w, o+r instead of chmod numbers !!!

     also see that the random 231 number matches all other files
     in the partition you're trying to add to. 

 % onspaces -a rootdbs         -p /private/apps/Informix/informix/dev/rootdbs_c2 -o 31490048  -s 32768

 % ontape -s -L 0

 check that space is available and ONLINE in ISA

STATUS: done and worked.

now try adding the new sysadmindbs_c1

 % UPDATE DOC TO show new offset

   new offset = old offset (31490048) + space added (32768KB) = 31522816

STATUS: done and good.  unused most likely ever--as sysadmin was moved to sysadmindbs.



******

if fails: 
drop chunk

% onspaces -d rootdbs -p /private/apps/Informix/informix/dev/rootdbs_c2 -o 31490048

% rm /dev/rdsk/c3t5d1s0 rootdbs_c2
