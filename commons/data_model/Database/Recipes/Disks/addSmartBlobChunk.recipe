Need to add a second chunk for smartdfltbs on embryonix -- filled because of
gbrowse blobs not being specified in smartbs.

as staylor on embryonix:

 % cd /private/apps/apache/bin

 % sudo apachectl stop

 kill all tomcats

 % kill `ps -e | grep jsvc | egrep -v grep | awk '{print $1}'`


As informix on embryonix

 % cd ~/informix/dev

 Find where there is free space to add a second chunk, preferably in the same partition as the current smartdfltbs.
http://zfin.org/zfin_doc/admin.html#NStor%204150S%20RAID

 There is room in the current partition. (see old ZFIN doc on mirror for an updated chart of 
 space availability).  

 **Always** check and update this doc--seriously, its all we have in times
 of crisis to determine where we can add chunks. 

 % ln -s /dev/rdsk/c2t1d3s6 smartdfltbs_c2

 check permissions
 
 % ls -lL

     see that new file has crw-rw---- privledges and is owned by informix
     and is in the informix group
     -c means you are dealing with RAW disk.

     make sure if you do have to change permissions
     that you do g+w, g+r, o+w, o+r instead of chmod numbers !!!

     also see that the random 231 number matches all other files
     in the partition you're trying to add to. 

 % onspaces -a smartdfltbs  -p /private/apps/Informix/informix/dev/smartdfltbs_c2 -o 22052864  -s 1048576 

 % ontape -s -L 0

 check that space is available and ONLINE in ISA

STATUS: done and worked.

now try adding the new sysadmindbs_c1

 % UPDATE DOC TO show new offset

   new offset = old offset (22052864) + space added (1048576KB) = 23101440

STATUS: 



******

if fails: 
drop chunk

% onspaces -d smartdfltbs -p /private/apps/Informix/informix/dev/smartdfltbs_c2 -o 22052864

% cd ~/informix/dev
% unlink smartdfltbs_c2
