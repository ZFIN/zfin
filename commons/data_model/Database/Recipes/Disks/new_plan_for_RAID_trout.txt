New plan for RAID:
--------------------------------------------------------------
1 drive group, 10 disks, 1 LUNs 

partition   size     usage
 1          3.5 TB   /zusers,
                     /zcentral,
                     /zarchive0,1,2,3,4
 2          1   TB   free (can become cooked, but RAW for now)
 3          2.5 TB   /zblastfiles,
                     /zblastdb,
                     /zunloads
 4          1   TB   free (can become cooked, but RAW for now)
 5          1.5 TB   RAW (informix)
 6          0.5 TB   free (can become RAW informix or cooked)


Gives us 1.5 TB of RAW Informix disk to work with.

onstat -d on current server gives amount allocated and space required in pages.

need to increase the size and/or number of logical logs.
need to increas the size of the physical log.

onstat -g ckp: is apparently helpful in determining phsylog performance, 
       	       but interpreting the meaning will take some time.

BUFFERPOOL = 4G on almost
	   doc suggests that for systems with bufferpool >= 4G, start the physlog at 4G, and increase
	   as necessary according to the online log warnings.


When oninit -i 'ing the server, we have to start it up with plog in the rootdbs (informix
rules).  We also start out with only 3 llog files and a much smaller llog. 
This means we have to have a oninit.i version of the file.

** Right now, these params are commented out next to their non-i params in the onconfig.

** Change rootdbs offset based on new server config and RAID config.

ROOTOFFSET

PHYSDBS   rootdbs
PHYSFILE  2000

LOGFILES  3
LOGSIZE   1500

RTO_SERVER_RESTART 60 # (1 minute fast recovery time as suggested by informix)

# CKPTINTVL  (comment out with RTO_SERVER_RESTART param set, it is ignored anyway).

AUTO_LRU_TUNING 1 # (auto tune the LRU's to match RTO_SERVER_RESTART parameter)

AUTO_CKPTS 1 # (turn these on too) 

OPT_GOAL 0 # change this to optimize for the first rows of data instead of all rows.

DYNAMIC_LOGS 0 # (notify DBA to add new logical logs when necessary: we'll add more by default and
                  only turn on this parameter if more doesn't work).

** plogdbs_c1 is 16384 pages on almost right now; 
   update that to at least: 2097152 pages (2K page size)

server admin guide for version 11 suggests setting LRU params up a bit higher: 70 and 80 respectively.
(these are ignored if RTO_SERVER_RESTART is enabled).

** lru_max_dirty=80.000000
** lru_min_dirty=70.000000

** add 30 extra logical logs to production and development (add extra space to development for growth).

?* NETTYPE to use NET type instead of CPU type.
?* add VPCLASS tli,num=1
