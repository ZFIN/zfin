===============================================================================
Sometimes tomcat has issues.  Either it has a memory heap overflow, or
it runs out of threads to use.  Both these errors show up as either
a slow website, phenote/quicksearch don't work, or are those applications
are so slow that they are basically not working.  The tomcat log (catalina.out)
is the best place to start to see if Tomcat is having issues.
===============================================================================

Start by checking the log (on helix, as informix):

% tail -f /private/apps/tomcat/logs/catalina.out

Sep 30, 2007 10:48:54 AM org.apache.tomcat.util.threads.ThreadPool logFull
SEVERE: All threads (150) are currently busy, waiting. Increase maxThreads (150) or check
the servlet status

This error indicates that we need to restart tomcat, first do a thread dump
with kill -3.

If you are src'd to an informix user, you can just type:

% kill -3 [jsvc process id]
% restarttomcat.pl

Check the logs again, to see if the server starts correctly.

% tail -f /private/apps/tomcat/logs/catalina.out

Sep 30, 2007 10:48:54 AM org.apache.tomcat.util.threads.ThreadPool logFull
SEVERE: All threads (150) are currently busy, waiting. Increase maxThreads (150) or check
the servlet status
Parse Done!

Sometimes the server does not restart on the first try.  The log above
shows a non-restarted server.

So, try again.

% restarttomcat.pl

And check the logs again:

% tail -f /private/apps/tomcat/logs/catalina.out

Oct 1, 2007 9:01:00 AM org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina start
INFO: Server startup in 30375 ms

And this shows the server has started.  The restarttomcat.pl script will
return before the server is completely up.  Give the server a few extra
seconds post-restart before worrying.
