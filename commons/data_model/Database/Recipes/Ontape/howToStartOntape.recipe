How to clean out old informix logs (we really only need as many days of logs as 
there are between informix level 0 backups)
**************************************************************************************
This recipe comes in a monthly email reminder to informix.  It needs to be done to
rotate/clear out old log files.  These log files are informix logical logs.  They
give us the ability to roll-forward from a crash post-checkpoint.  We need only as many
log files as there are since the last level 0 dump. 

This recipe can also be used to start logging on helix/production when/if informix is 
restarted after a server crash or other downtime.

How do I know when this needs to be done (symptoms):

1) if cron is running on production you will have received about 10,000 email messages
that tell you that Wildtype is ABNORMAL! and that you need to check ontape.

2) When the logical log files fill up (after about 2 days of no logging), the engine
will hang and there will be messages as to what is going on in the online.log (onstat -m
as informix).

x. source helix

      as informix on helix:
       % srchelix 
 
x. find the process id of ontape
       % ps -ef | grep ontape 
     
(if no ontape -c process is found, skip the kill command below and just issue the gmake dumpLogsContinuous command:)
   
x.  issue a kill command for the ontape process 
       % kill [found_process_id_from_above]
       % cdhelix 
       % cd server_apps/DB_maintenance/ 
       % gmake dumpLogsContinuous 
      
x. dump the informix server 
       % cd /research/zprod/www_homes/zfin.org/server_apps/DB_maintenance/
       % ./dumpServer.pl  (will require a return and will take about 2 minutes, don't panic)

x. If this routine completes successfully, delete the old log file with
   last month's datetime stamp.

       % cd /research/zprod/www_homes/zfin.org/server_apps/DB_maintenance/
   
x. Confirm that the logs symlink is pointing to a logfile with 
   today's date.
       % ls -al logs

x. Confirm that the data symlink is pointing to a data file with today's
   date.  Will be created with the dumpServer.pl script

       % ls -al data

x. Remove the old log file that the logs symlink is NOT pointing to.

       % rm log[the_date_to_delete.0]

x. Else, wait untill tomorrow, and make sure we have a dump from tonight's
   cron job and delete the historical log file with last month's
   datetime stamp then.
