This directory should contain the ER/Studio production model.  (The 
Models directory holds the development models.)

In ER/Studio, you should set your Reference Models Directory to this directory:

   Tools->Options->Directories->Referennce Models

We aren't quite sure yet how the Models and Reference directories will
interact.
