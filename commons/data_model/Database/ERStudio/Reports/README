This directory should contain ER/Studio report templates.  

In ER/Studio, you should set your Reports Directory to this directory:

   Tools->Options->Directories->Reports

We aren't sure yet if we will have one report template, or many.

Note that this directory does NOT contain the output of the reports(s) -- it 
contains the template(s) used to produce the output.  The output of 
the report(s) goes in Commons/doc/Database/DataModel.
