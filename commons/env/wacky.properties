# This script should be sourced to set Informix environment variables to
# the values needed for the wavy Informix server on Bionix.
#
# This script ASSUMES the following:
#
# o If a shell variable called $PREINFORMIXPATH already exists then it 
#   contains the value of $PATH before any Informix information was 
#   added to it.  If the $PREINFROMIXPATH variable does not already 
#   exist then this script defines it.
#
# o If a shell variable called $PREINFORMIX_LD_PATH is set then
#   this script will use it to set the $LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable.  If it 
#   is not set then this script will override the incoming setting, if any,
#   of the $LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable.
#

# Set standard Informix variables
