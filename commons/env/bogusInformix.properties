# This script is used with mirror sites that don't actually use an 
# informix server because mirror sites don't have databases.  However,
# the makefiles require that several Informix variables be set.  This
# script sets the required variables to bogus values.
#
# NOTE: The makefiles check for the particular value of INFORMIXSERVER
#       that is set by this file,  Whenever INFORMIXSERVER has this
#       particular value, you are prevented from running gmake without
#       a target.
