This design is largely copied from processGB.sh and other scripts in http://zfinwinserver1.uoregon.edu/fogbugz/default.asp?W407 

TODO: likely all of the downloading (Genbank, RefSeq, Ensemble, etc.) will be done up-front, fasta conversion next, so-on and so-forth.

Need to process genbank since everything else is built on top of genbank:

- get all download sequences for genbank
- convert to fasta by type (record accessions?)
- assemble necessary according to rules set by each
- convert to blast database
- mv to target(s)

(Repeat for Refseq, Ensembl)


Process things with local accessions based on genomic DBs:
# zfin_cdna
# ZFINGenesWithExpression
# GenomicDNA 
# gbk_zf_dna (can be NO DNA?) TODO


Cleared (very easy):
# THESE START OUT EMPTY or with current accessions, so nothing to do
unreleasedRNA 
unreleasedProtein

# these are generated once! from server_apps/data_transfer/transcript out of MarkerSequence, need to make sure that we dump the fasta-file, creating fasta + dblinks 
# TODO: do xdformat, add to accession bank?

Things from unspecified scripts (or scripts we need to create):
zfin_mrph - MarkerSequence 
repbase_zf
publishedProtein (from Tom)


Regenerate generated scripts based on heirarchy:
- .... can this be based on fasta and/or wublast?


Transfer files to final destination(s).
