--P_2_LINKAGE_PAIRS.SQL
------------------------------------------------------
--procedure to check inserts and/or updates on the linkage_pair_member table.
--assumptions: a linkage_pair must have 2 and only 2 members, 
--and linkage_pairs historically have not included
--more than 2 linkage_pair_members, so we should never have to account for 
--linkage_pairs
--that have more than 2 lkpair members. So we will alert the user if the 
--lkpair already has -->1 member (2 that is), but, if there are 
--already > 2 members for a linkage_pair, this procedure will not 
--indicate this to the user.  It will just not let the user add additional.
--REPLACES:
--sub linkagePairHas2Members
