Frodo Recipe (the paranoid approach):

So, instead of running Fv4.sh and dealing with all the hassle that goes
with it, do this:

from the top of your branch:
% cvs -q update -dP
% loaddb.pl [your db name] /research/zunloads/databases/frodo/2006.09.27.2/
% gmake postloaddb
% gmake 

and you should have an updated database and software file structure ready
for testing (you do not have to run regen_names after this load, it has  
already been executed).
