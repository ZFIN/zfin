   <b>Experiment Table</b> <br>

<p>  
  <i>exp_zdb_id:</i> A ZFIN-specific unique identifier.  At ZFIN, unique ids are of the form "ZDB-[TABLE_PREFIX]-[DATE]-[SERIAL_NUMBER]." <br>
  <i>exp_name:</i> An optional name of an experiment/environment specifically used to help curators group a set of environmental conditions together.  This name is not displayed on zfin.org.<br>
  <i>exp_source_zdb_id:</i> The unique identifier that represents a single publication in which the experiment was illucidated.

<p>
  This table holds a unique identifier for every environment/experiment recorded in a paper.  At ZFIN, an environment (also called "experiment") is the sum total of all non-genetic conditions under which an organism is held.  Genetic conditions are described and recorded in the "genotype/feature" area of the database.  Genetic conditions include allelic variations, transgenes, backgrounds, zygocity, etc...Non-genetic conditions include changes in temperature, chemical additives, transient features like morpholinos or RNAi constructs, salinity changes, etc...

<p>ZFIN also has a few restricted environments that are used often by Zebrafish researchers.  The "_Standard" environment consists of standard temperature (27 degrees C) and pressure conditions.  Often, the "_Standard" environment is the default environment.  Kind of like our "WT" (wildtype) zebrafish, the "_Standard" environment is a placeholder for environments that aren't diagramed by the researcher.

<p>It is also possible to describe the husbandry conditions used to maintain a fish line (at a resource center, for example) in the experiment/environment tables.  ZFIN does not currently have these kinds of environmental/husbandry data yet.

   <b>Experiment Condition Table</b> <br>

<p>  
  <i>expcond_zdb_id:</i> A ZFIN-specific unique identifier.  At ZFIN, unique ids are of the form "ZDB-[TABLE_PREFIX]-[DATE]-[SERIAL_NUMBER]." <br>
  <i>expcond_exp_zdb_id:</i> The unique identifier for the group of conditions (the experiment/environment id, of which each particular condition is a part of<br>
  <i>expcond_value:</i> The value of the condition (for example: 24 would be the value of a temperature condition)<br>
  <i>expcond_comments:</i> Optional comments available for curators<br>
  <i>expcond_cdt_zdb_id:</i> An identifier that constrains the types of conditions that can be listed in this table.  This id refers to the condition_data_type table.  For example, the id here represents the condition "temperature" for the example above.
  <i>expcond_mrkr_zdb_id:</i> An identifier that describes a "molecular" environment condition.  This column currently holds any kind of genetic feature that can be injected into a fish but does not become a heritable part of its genotype.  For example, morpholino ids are stored in this column.
  <i>expcond_expunit_zdb_id:</i> An identifier that constrains the kind of units that can be used with each particular condition represented in the <i>expcond_cdt_zdb_id</i> id.  For example, temperature conditions can only be expressed in degrees Celcius at ZFIN.  See the condition_data_type table and the experiment_unit table for more details.

<p>
  This table holds the conditions of an environment/experiment.  For example, salinity, water temperature, morpholinos used, and pressure changes are all environmental conditions that can be recorded in this table.  Curators are able to enter values for each condition (such as the value "24" for a temperature condition).  For more complicated conditions (like morpholinos), the curator can specify which morpholino was used (in the expcond_mrkr_zdb_id column), and then provide the value/concentration of that injection condition (like 25 ng/M).  The condition_data_type for a morpholino would be simply named "morpholino."

<p>Examples of this kind of data can be seen in a summarized form at: <a href="http://zfin.org/cgi-bin/webdriver?MIval=aa-xpatexpcdndisplay.apg&cdp_exp_zdb_id=ZDB-EXP-060721-1">zfin</a>.

   <b>Condition Data Type Table</b> <br>

<p>  
  <i>cdt_zdb_id:</i> A ZFIN-specific unique identifier.  At ZFIN, unique ids are of the form "ZDB-[TABLE_PREFIX]-[DATE]-[SERIAL_NUMBER]." <br>
  <i>cdt_name:</i>the name of a particular condition, like 'stable', 'high', 'morpholino', 'PTU', etc...<br>
  <i>cdt_group:</i>the group to which a cdt_name belongs like: 'molecular reagent', 'temperature', 'salinity', 'chemical', etc...<br>
  <i>cdt_significance:</i> Ordering column for pull down lists<br>

<p>This table defines a two level hierarchy for environmental/experimental conditions at ZFIN. While ZFIN chose to implement this as a hierarchy with a defined depth, it is projected that an environmental condition ontology could easily be constructed. Until we decide to move in the direction of fully annotated environments, a two level hierarchy fulfills our requirements.

  This table is also know (in the fifth version of the phenotype module in the Chado schema) as the "phenotypeCharacteristic" table.  It holds a single phenotype annotation.  One genotype in a particular environment may have several atomic phenotypes or "phenotype characteristics."  The list of all of these characteristics together is the recorded phenotype for that particular genotype/environment combination.  Genotype/Environment combinations are represented in this table by the "apato_genox_zdb_id."  Tags, are non-ontological terms used to represent mutant phenotype characteristics.  Tags are most often used on old data that was entered prior to the development of the PATO ontology.
